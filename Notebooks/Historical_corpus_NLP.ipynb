They do not here intend \\nto draw a comparison between this and the Elemen- \\ntary Treatises on Botany in our own language ; but \\nit may be allowable to say that it contains many \\nthings which are not to be found in any of them ; \\nparticularly an explanation of the phenomena of Vo* \\ngetable Physiology, on the principles of the latest \\ndiscoveries in Chemistry, There are also added sec- \\ntions on the Diseases of Plants, a History of the \\nScience, and an account of Botanical Writers. The \\nPlates illustrate every Botanical term ; and the table \\nof Colours, which is altogether new, will be of es- \\nsential use to students, not of Botany only, but also \\nof Natural Histoj-y in general. \\n\\nADVERTISEMENT \\nTO THE \\nSECOND EDITION, \\nE success of tliis\\'Work has induced the Author \\nto revise ^nd impr6ve it.

The Editors have pro- \\ncured the last edition; what is new they have translat- \\ned, and have carefully attended to those alterations in \\nthe arrahgement, which the Author had found neces- \\nsary. \\'An additional explanatory plate has been en- \\ngraved, and great care has been taken in correctintt \\nthe iiideXj so as to ipake. it serve as a glossary of all \\nthe terms.

Aristotle was the first who established \\nthe division into the three well known kinjidonis of \\nNature, namely, the Animal, Vegetable, and Mi- \\nneral or Fossil Kingdoms*. — (Regnum animak, n:t- \\ngetabilc, lapidcum vel m\\'mcrale.) \\n§ 3- \\nThe three kingdoms of Nature differ in their \\npower of propagation. Fossils have no organs of ge- \\nneration ; they remain always the same, or are only \\ncapable of forming various compounds, but never \\nproduce their like. Plants are furnished with a \\ngreat number of genital organs ; but they lose them \\nbefore their death, and often acquire fresh sets : \\nAnimals, on the contrary, retain their organs until \\ndeath t- ^ \\n* Some have proposed to add an Aqueous and an Igneous \\nKingdom ; and Munchausen an intermediate kingdom con- \\ntaining the Fungi, Corallia and Polypi ; Avhile others hare \\nadopted only two kingdoms, the Living and Lifeless; but \\nthis last arrangement is insufficient, because the former must \\nbe subdivided into Animals and Plants ; and in like manner^ \\nthe proposed new kingdoms of nature arc superfluous. \\n+ Various means have been devised for discriminating Plants \\nand Animals ; but hitherto no one has been so fortunate as to \\ndiscover a clear and satisfactory distinction, because nature \\nhas not separated them by any accurate limits. Loco-motion, \\nthe voluntary motion of particular parts, the orifice by which \\nthe food is taken in, and that by which the superfluous parts \\nof it are discharged, are indeed characteristic marks of the \\n\\nintroduction:. \\n3 \\n§ 4. \\nThat science which teaches us to distinguish one \\nplant from every other, and leads us to the know- \\nledge of hs peculiarities, is called Botany, (Botct- \\nnice, Botanica, Scientia botanica, Phytologia, Bo- \\ntanologia.) \\nTo teach this science properly, we must make the \\nstudent acquainted with every particular part of a \\nplant, and its use. This is the purpose of the fol- \\nlowing work : but before proceeding, we must pre- \\nmise a few necessary hints and general observa- \\ntions *. \\n§ 5. \\nThe first object of a student of Botany, after be- \\ncoming acquainted with the Terminology, is to gain \\nanimal kingdom, and are obvious in the larger animals. But \\nare there not certain plants which are endowed with volun- \\ntary motion, and which, in some respects, move from one \\nplace to another? and who can shew ns, in the infusory ani- \\nmals, or in those allied to them, which resemble the Confer- \\nvas, the Tremellas, and other small plants, the organs ap- \\npropriated for the reception of the food or its discharge ? \\n(Smellie\\'s philosophy of Natural History, may be consulted \\nfor a fuller account of the aflfinity of these kingdoms.) \\n* Particular branches of this science have also particular \\nnames : for instance, when the subject relates to trees and \\nshrubs alone, it is called Dendrologia ; when to the grasses, \\nAgrostographia, when to those plants whose flowera are not \\nobvious, Crypto gamologia. Botany may even according (o \\nits various uses be divided into economical, tec/mological, and \\nmedicinal. \\nA 2 \\n\\n4 \\nINTllODUCTIOy. \\nan accuriitc knowledge of every plant as it comes in \\nhis way. He must acquire what may be called a \\nbotanical glance ; that is, he must accustom his eye \\nto run over the stem, the leaves in all their struc- \\nture, the mode of inflorescence, and all the other \\nconspicuous parts of a plant, so as to discover by \\nmere inspection, determinate characters distinguish- \\ning it from similar plants. In this way he becomes \\nenabled to know plants by the external appearance \\nor habit (habitus.) With this knowledge, however, \\nhe must not be contented, but must examine more \\naccurately, the parts of the flower and fruit (partes \\nfructijicationis), and be able to find in them cer \\ntain and fixed characters ; and, till he has attained \\nthis power, his knowledge cannot be said to rest on \\nscientific principles. To derive the proper advan- \\ntage from such knowledge, he must endeavour to \\nimprint the form of the plants he sees upon his me- \\nmory. But, as from the immense number of plants \\nthis is almost impossible, and often at particular \\nseasons of the year, plants which we would wish to \\ncompare with one another are not to be found, we \\nmust endeavour to assist ourselves by a collection of \\ndried plants (Hortus siccus, Herbarium). The rules \\nto be observed in forming such a collection are the \\nfollowing. \\n1. The plant is to be laid between folds of blos- \\nsom paper, the parts of it properly spread out, and \\nthe paper often changed, that the plant may not \\nshrivel or become black : this is to be done in a \\nmoderately warm place, exposed to the sun, ancj \\nwhere there is a free current of air. \\n\\nINTRODUCTION. \\n5 \\n2. In drying the plant we must take care to jrive \\nthe parts no unnatural direction ; for instance, we \\nmust not give to a flower, which naturally hangs \\ndown, an erect position ; flower-stalks that are at- \\ntached to one side must not be turned to both, a \\ncrooked or procumbent stem, must be preserved in \\nthat state, &c. \\n3. The plants must be gathered at that particular \\ntime when they possess all the characters by which \\nthey are distinguished from similar plants ; whe- \\nther the diflTerence be in the root, in the radical \\nleaves, or in the fruit, these parts, as being essen- \\ntial, must not be wanting. \\n4. Plants should not be gathered in moist wea^ \\nther, because, in that case they generally turn black \\nin drying ; and when it so happens, they must be \\nleft to dry for some time in the air, \\n5. Succulent plants may be dried either with a \\nwarm stone or a hot iron ; or, what is better, they \\nmay be immersed in boiling water for some minutes, \\nand after being carefully wiped dry with blossom \\npaper, treated in the usual way ; but the paper \\nmust be often changed. The flowers must not be \\nallowed to get wet, but must be gently compres- \\nsed. \\n6. Plants, which are succulent, and at the same \\ntime delicate, such as the Iris, must be dried be- \\ntween folds of writing paper, after having the cap- \\nsule slightly bruised ; and the paper is not to be \\nopened up till the whole plant is thoroughly dry. \\n7. The Algae must likewise be dried. Such as \\ngrow out of the water, upon stones, the bark of \\nA 3 \\n\\nI^JTKODUCTIOX. \\ntrees, &c. may be preserved without any furtlier \\npreparation with the bodies on wiiich tliey are found. \\nTlie aquatic algae must be spread out under water \\non fine paper laid over a plate of glass, and gra- \\ndually, when they are properly disposed on the paper, \\nlifted out of the water and then dried. \\n8. But the Musci, after being carefully plucked a- \\nsunder, must be thrown into a vessel of water, and \\nthen laid between two leaves of moistened writing \\npaper, which may be put in an old book with a con- \\nsiderable weight on it. Mosses dried in this way, \\nthough they may look well, lose in part their natural \\nappearance ; it is better therefore, not to press them \\ntoo hard, because they can be afterwards easier re- \\nstored and examined. \\nQ. Pressure is likewise used for thistles and other \\nstrong leaved plants. \\n10. The Fungi in general cannot be dried, except \\nsome of the smaller and coriaceous kinds ; and a few \\nof the larger ones may be prepared by being immer- \\nsed ia boiling water. \\nWhen a collection of dried plants is thus made, \\nthey are to be laid each in a sheet of white paper, \\nand arranged according to some system, and kept \\nin a close cabinet, that they may not be eaten by in- \\nsects. We may also lay in the drawers small bits of \\nspunge moistened with oil of rosemary or cajuput \\nwrapt in paper, v, hich w ill banish these depredators : \\neven by frequent perusal the collection is preserve^ \\nfrom them. \\nSome botanists, and Linnaeus himself, advise the \\nf4Stening of the plants to the paper. But many ip- \\n\\nINTRODUCTION. \\n7 \\nconveniencies attend this practice ; for, we can only \\nsee one side of the leaf, and cannot examine the \\nflower at all, especially when it is small. For a bo- \\ntanist it is much better to keep the plant loose, be- \\ncause it is often necessary to soften the flowers by \\nmeans of warm water, in order to examine their \\nform more accurately ; he can also substitute a bet- \\nter specimen occasionally for an indifferent one, and \\nsave the time spent in fixing them. If however, it \\nbe wished to fix the plants, the object may be at- \\ntained by pasting slips of paper over the stem, or by \\nmeans of a thread. \\nBut an Herbarium alone is not sufficient for the \\npurposes of a botanist ; he must likewise collect the \\nseeds of most plants and their fruit, especially those \\nthat can be preserved, because an acquaintance \\nwith these is of the greatest importance to him. \\n§ 6. \\nThe surface of the different parts of plants is very \\nmultifarious. The followinij terms have been set- \\ntied, and are used in the description of all these va- \\nrious parts : \\n1. Shining (nitidtis), where the surface is so \\nsmooth that it reflects the rays of light, and has \\na shining or glancing appearance, as in the leaves \\nof the holly. Ilex aquijolium. \\n2.

Most plants \\nhave two principal parts which particularly strike \\nus, namely the descending stem^ (caudex descendens) \\nand the ascending (adscendens). In some there is \\neven a third part, namely the intermediate stem, \\n(Caudex intermedins). \\n§ 10. \\nThe descending stem (^Caudex descendens) is \\nthat part of the plant which takes its direction down- \\nwards. In most plants it enters the earth ; in others \\nit adheres to extraneous bodies M\\'hich serve for its \\npoint of attachment, as in Lichens and some tuberous \\nparasitical plants ; and lastly in some it penetrates \\nthe substance on which it fixes itself, as in the \\nViscum, Loranthus and others. \\n\\n14 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANV, ETC. \\nThe descendins caudex takes the name of Root \\n(radix) The parts of which the root consists are the \\nRhizoma, the Fibrillar, the Radicuice, the TubePy the \\nBulbus, and the Soboles. \\n§11. \\nThe IIhizoma is that part of a biennial or lasting \\nroot, more or less thick, which appears in different \\nforms. In biennial and perennial plants it is for the \\nmost part fleshy ; in shrubs and trees it is woody ; \\nand in all, in two or more years, according to the \\nnature of the plant, it sets off one or more shoots, \\n(Turiones ), as in Daucus Carota^ Poly podium vul- \\ngcire, Astragalus, &c. \\nThe FiBiiiLLAE are those parts of the root which \\nhave the appearance of threads, and are sometimes \\ni^traight and sometimes variously bent; they are \\nattached to the Rhizoma, the tubercles or bulbs, and \\n^ometinies to the intermediate part (§ 1 3). There \\nare roots which have no Rhizoma, and consist en- \\ntirely of these fibrillae. \\nThe Radicular are extremely fine and hair-like \\nprolongations of the root, which are properly but \\nabsorbent vessels or their prolongations, by which \\nthe plants are nourished. They are sometimes so \\nfine that we can scarcely observe them with the \\nnaked eye, and, like the leaves, they are, in lasting \\nroots, renewed yearly. \\nThe Tuber is a thick fleshy part of the root, of \\nvarious figure, which produces one or more bodies \\nsimilar to itself and then perishes; and from its \\nwhole surface; or from its top, or its base, one or \\n\\nTERMINOLOGY. \\n15 \\nmore shoots proceed ; e. g. Solanum tuberosuvj, \\nSpiraea FUipendida, Orchis and others. \\nThe BuLBus is a lleshy, coated body, more or less \\nsohd, round and gross, that is firmly united with a \\nroot small in respect of the bulb, which is placed \\nsometimes at the base and sometimes in the middle. \\nIt pushes its shoot either from the middle or the \\nbase, which depends on the situation of the root, \\n(Rhizoma). \\nThe SoBOLES is a prolongation of the root, pro- \\nceeding horizontally under the earth, for the most \\npart filiform, and producing new plants of its \\nkind, e. g. Triticum repens, and many others. \\n§ 12. \\nAccording to most of the above named parts \\nthe different species of roots may be divided and \\nnamed, viz. RhizomatoidecF, Jibrillatae, tuheroscn, \\nbulboscE, and notha\\\\ or spurious ones. To this last \\ndivision belong those roots which do not enter the \\nearth, but are otherwise attached.

The fol- \\nlowing divisions of it have been made — ^The Stock \\n(Corn:ius), the Inflorescence, (Inflorescentia), the \\nleaves, (Folia), the Frond, (Frons), the Props, (Ful- \\ncra), the Flowers, (Flores), the Fruity (Fructus), and \\nthe BasCj (Basis). \\n^ 15. \\nThe Stock (Cormus) is that part of the plant \\nwhich serves for the support of the whole, and bears \\nthe inflorescence, the leaves, the frond, the props, \\nthe flowers and fruit. From it are evolved in most \\ncases all these parts ; but amid the vast diversities \\n\\nTERMINOLOGY. \\nwhich prevail in the vegetable kingdom, it will not \\nbe surprising that this part should put on very va- \\nrious appearances. Accordingly, the following \\ntwelve kinds have been distinguished : viz. the Stem \\n(Caudex), the Trunk (Truncus), the Stalk (Caulis), \\nthe Straw (Culmus), the Scape (Scapus), the Stipe \\n(Stipes), the Sfwot (Surculus), the Sarment (Sar- \\nmentum), the Sucker (Stolo), the leafstalk (Petio- \\nlus), the Jlower-stalk (Pedunculus), and the bristle \\n(Seta). \\n§ \\\\6. \\nThe Stem (Caudex) is a simple perennial rod, with \\nleaves at its extremity, peculiar only to the Palms \\nand arboreous Filices, having no bark, but set round \\nwith the remains of the leaf-stalks. Of this there \\nare the following kinds : \\n1. Ringed, (annulata), when the remains of the \\nleaves at regular distances resemble annular eleva- \\ntions ; as Corypha rotundifolia. \\n2. Scaly (squamosus), when the remains of the \\nleaves surround the stem irregularly ; as in Phoenix \\ndactylifera, Chamaerops humilis. \\n3. Tessellated, (tessulatus), when the leaf, or \\nthe base of the stipe (§ 21.) docs not remain behind, \\nbut leaves a scar, by which the stem puts on a \\ntessellated appearance; as, Polypodium rtr/wcww. \\n4. Aculeated, (aculeotus), when the remains of \\nthe leaf are set with prickles ; as in Cocos aculeatus, \\n^^lypodium asperum. \\n5. Siiiootfi, finermis), the- opposite of the last, \\nB 4 \\n\\n24! PRINCIPLES OF BOTANV, ETC. \\nwhen the remains of the leaf leave no prickles ; as \\nPhoenix dactylifcra^ Polypodium arhoreum. \\n§ 17. \\nThe Trunk (Truncus) is peculiar to trees and \\nshrubs, and is perennial. The principal stem in \\nthese plants has obtained tlie following denomina- \\ntions; its principal divisions are called branches (Ra- \\nmi), and its subdivisions twigs (Ramuli). \\nL Tree-Hke, {arhoreus)\\\\ this is simple, and \\nforms at top a crowd or crown of branches (cacu- \\nmen); it is peculiar to trees. \\n2. Shrubby, (fruticosus), divided below into a \\nnumber of branches, like all shrubs. \\n§ 18. \\nThe Stalk (Caulis) is herbaceous, seldom woody, \\nand lasts but one or two years ; hence it is proper \\nonly to herbaceous plants : however the term is \\nsometimes applied both to trees and shrubs. The \\ndivisions of this are also called branches (Rami), \\nThe kinds are, \\na. With respect to division : \\n1. Very simple, (simpUcissimus)y that has no \\nbranches, nor is its flower-stalk divided ; consequent- \\nly it can have but one flower or spike, and no flowers \\nin the axillae of the branches. \\n9,.

Much branched, (ramosissimiis), where all the \\nbranches are not only divided but subdivided. \\n6. Disappearing, (deliquescem)^ branched, but so \\ndivided that the principal stem is no longer to be \\nobserved, but is lost in the ramification. \\n7. Intire, (integer), which is branched, but where \\nthe principal stem can be traced to the point. \\n8. Verticiliated, (t\\'erticii/alus), when a number \\nof branches are formed at the extremity, from the \\ncentre of which the principal stem proceeds, so that \\nthe branches at certain distances surround the stem \\nin a circular manner : as in Pinus sylvestris. \\n9. Proliferous, (proUjer), where the stem is divi- \\nded into a number of branches, and these acfain like- \\nwise divide, but the principal stem does not proceed \\nfrom the centre of them ; as, Ledum palustre. \\n10. Dichotoinous, (dichotomus), when the stem, \\neven to the smallest branches divides itself into two j \\nas Viscum album, Valeriana olitoria \\nb. In respect of the Branches. \\n11. Alternate branches, (ramis alternis). The \\nbranches are so placed that between two on the one \\nside there rises but one on the opposite side. \\n12. Opposite branches, (ramis oppositis), when \\none branch stands on the opposite side to another, \\nand the bases of each nearly meet together. \\n13. Distichous, (distichus), when the branches \\nbeing opposite to each other, stand on the same \\nplane. \\n\\niS PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\n14.

Here follow tlie different kinds of \\nRaceme : \\n1. One-sided, (unilateralis), when only one side \\nof the stem is set with flowers. \\n2. One-rowed, (seciindiis), when the flower-stalks \\nare situated round the principal stem, but the flowers \\nthemselves are directed only to one side. \\n3.

As an example of the Fasciculus may be \\nquoted Dianthus carthusianorwn. \\nJ 34. \\nThe UMBEL, (umbella), consists of a number of \\nflower-stalks of equal length that rise from the point. \\nIn an Umbel the flower-stalks are called rays, ( radii). \\nThere arc the following varieties of the Umbel : \\n1 . Simple, (simplci\\'), when the rays bear but one \\nflower. \\n2. Compound, ( composita ), when each ray of the \\numbel supports a simple umbel, fig. 86. The rays \\nwhich support the simple umbels are called the uni- \\nversal or general umbel, (umbella universalis). The \\nsimple umbels are called the particular or partial um- \\nbels, ( umbella partialis s. umbellula ). \\n3. Sitting, (sessilis), when the umbel has no stalk. \\n4.

All flower-stalks \\nthat are contained in a vagina, are called Spadix. \\nThis organ is sometimes formed like a spike, race- \\nmus, or panicle, and from these it takes its name, \\nfig. 41, 42. \\nThe terms appropriated to it are the following, \\n1.

They are sometimes of a quite different \\nshape from the proper leaves, but sometimes no way \\ndifferent, except in situation and size. They may be \\ndistinguished by the following terms : \\n1. Double, (geminae), when two are present, \\nwhich always stand opposite, fig. 27, 30, 32. \\n2. Solitary, (solitariae), when a single stipule \\nstands upon one side of the leaf foot-stalk. \\n3. Lateral, (lateralcs), when they stand at the \\norigin of the petiolus, fig. 27, 30, 32. \\n* The leaves of the Lcmna must also be called fronds, as \\nthey are connected with the root in a particular manner; and \\nthe flowers sit upon them. \\n\\n76 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\n4.

They are often marked with a dark brown spot, as in \\nVicia saiiva, and then they are called sphacelatae.

It is common to all palms, to \\nmost lihes and arums. Of it there are the following \\nkinds : \\n1. Univalve, (univalvis), when it consists but of \\none leaf, as in Arum inaculatim, fig. 41. \\n2. Bivalve, (bivahisj, when two leaves stand op- \\nposite to each other, as in the fresh-water soldier, \\nStratiotes abides, \\n3. Vague, ( mgue ), when there is not only a large \\ncommon vagina, but likewise separate vaginae for \\neach particular division of the flower-stem, and for \\neach particular flower. \\n4. Halved, (dimidiata), the same wiih univalve, \\nonly the flowers are covered but on one side. \\n5. One-flowered, iwo-flowered, &c. many-flower- \\ned, (uni-bi-multiflo7\\'a), when it includes one or more \\nflowers. \\n6. Withering, (marcescens), when it withers at \\nflowering, or a short while before. \\n7. Permanent, (persist ens when it remains un- \\nchanged till the fruit ripens. \\n\\nTERMINOLOGY. \\n79 \\n§ 51. \\nThe ROLL, (ochrea)j is a leaf-like body, which \\nsurrounds the branches of the flower-stalk in some \\ngrasses, in the manner of a cylindrical sheath. This \\nis chiefly to be observed in the \\'genus Cyperus, \\nfig. 291. The margin of it is various, and affords \\nthe following diversities : \\n1. Truncated, (truncata), when the margin is \\neven, as if it had been cut off. \\n2. Oblique, ( obliqua ), when the margin\\' is some- \\nwhat lengthened out on one side. \\n3. Foiiaceous, (foliacea J, when the roll ends in a \\nshort, linear, or subulated leaf. \\nIt is further distinguished according to its furface, \\nas in § 6. \\nJ 52. \\nThe BOTTLE, (ascidium), is a particular foiiaceous \\nbody that is cylindrical and hollow, and often has its \\nmouth furnished with a complete cover, which opens \\noccasionally. This body generally contains pure \\nwater. It is either sitting, ( sessile), or supported on \\na foot-stalk, (petiolatum), and is situated at the ex- \\ntremity of a leaf. The latter is found in the Nepen- \\nthes destillatoriay fig. 28, the former in Sarracenia. \\nIn two genera, namely the Ascium and Ruyschia, \\nthere are bracteae which have the appearance of an \\nAscidium, and are therefore called Bracteae ascidi- \\nformes, fig. 117, 121. Similar bracteae are to be \\nfound in the genus Marcgrafia. \\n\\ngo \\nriUNCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\n§53. \\nThe BLADDER, (ampulla), is a round, hollow, \\ndosed body, that is found at the roots of some wa- \\nter-plants, as Utricularia, Aldrovanda, Sec. fig. 288. \\nIn maritime plants, asin Fucus, these ampullae have \\nsometimes a singular form, which foriTierly gave rise- \\nto the opinion that they were the fruit of the plant. \\n§54. \\nTiie sTfiAP, (ligula), is a membranaceous, small, \\ntransparent leafct. which is situated on the margin \\nof the vagina, and at the base of the leaf. It is only \\nproper to the Grasses, fig. 26. It affords the fol- \\nlowing varieties : \\n1 . Intire, ( integra J, when it has no segments. \\n2. Bifid, (bijida), when it is divided at the apex. \\n3. Torn, (lacera), when it is irregularly, as it \\nWere, torn on the margin. \\n4. Fringed, ( ciliata ), when tiie margin is set with \\nshort, projecting hairs. \\n5. Truncated, (truncataj, when the upper part \\nterminates in a transverse line. \\n6. Pointed, ( acuta J, that has a short acute point. \\n7. Acuminated, (acuminata), that has a long pro- \\njecting point. \\n8. Very short, (decurrens), that is hardly visible, \\nand runs down the inside of the vagina. \\no \\n§ 55. \\nThe INVOLUCRE, (wTolucrum), consists of several \\nleaves that differ in form from the proper leaves of \\n\\nTERMrNOLCrGY. \\n81 \\nthe plant ; they sarronnd one or several flowers and \\nenclose them before they unfold. The involucrum is \\nparticularly found in the umbelliferous plants, § 34. \\nThere are several varieties of it, viz. \\n1. Common, (universale J, which encloses all the \\nflower-stalks, fig. 36. \\n2. Partial, fpartiak), which encloses the partial \\numbels only. \\n3. Halved, (dimidiatum), which sun*ounds only \\nhalf of the stem. \\n4. Hanging, (depe7idens), when all the leafets \\nhang down, as in Aethusa Cyriapntm. \\n5. Two, three, four, or many leaved, ( di, fri, te- \\ntra, or polyp hy Hum), that consists of two or more \\nleafets *. \\nThe FUNGI differ so much in external appearance \\nfrom other plants, that their parts cannot be com- \\npared with them. The principal parts are tne Vol- \\nva, Annulus and Pileus. \\nThe WRAPPER, (whaj, is a thick, and, in general, \\nfleshy membrane, that envelopes the fungus in its \\nyoung and unexpanded state, and when it is full \\ngrown remains close upon the ground. It has been \\n* The Involucrum has sometimes the appearance of a Ca- \\nlyx, § 74, and then is said to be calyciform, ( calyciforme), as \\nin the liverwort, Anemone Hepatica.

There are the following varieties of the annulus. \\n1. Upright, (crectus)j when the ring is fixed be- \\nlow, but free above, fig. 4. \\n2. Inverted, (inversus), when the ring is fixed \\nabove, but free below, so that it is bell-shaped and \\nhangs down, as in Agaricus mappa. \\n3. Sitting, ( sessUis), when, as in the above species, \\nit is always attached by one side. \\n4. Moveable, ( mobilis), when the ring can be push- \\ned up and down, as in Agaricus antiquatus. \\n5. Permanent, (pei^sistens), when it is found dur- \\ning the whole existence of the fungus. \\n6. Fugacious, (f itga.rj, when at the perfect deve- \\nlopement of the fungus the ring disappears. \\n7. Cobweb-like, (arachnoideus J, when the ring is \\ncomposed of a very white web. Rings of this kind \\nare often evanescent*. \\n* The Ring is properly a prolongation of the membrane of \\nthe pileus, part of which remains upon the stalk ; but in some \\nfungi it does not separate from the rim of the pileus, but from \\nthe stalk, and remains attached to the pileus, in longer or \\nshorter portions according to the species. In this case it is \\ncalled cortina. \\n\\nTERMINOLOGY. \\n83 \\n§ 58. \\nThe CAP, (pileiis X is the top of the fungus, in ge- \\nneral shaped like a plate or bonnet, and supported \\nby the stalk, ( stipes).

All \\nI^ants are not furnished with buds, but only such as \\ngrow in cold climates. They either inclose leaves \\nalone, (foiuferae) ; or leaves and flowers in separate \\nbuds, (foiuferae et floriferae distinctae ) ; or leaves \\nand female flowers, (foliiftrae et floriferae femi- \\nTieae) ; or leaves and male flowers, (foliiferae et flo- \\nrifei\\'ae masculae ) : or leaves and hermaphrodite \\nflowers, (foiuferae et floriferae hermaphroditae ) : or \\nlastly, leaves and flow-ers in one bud, (foliiferoflo\\' \\nriferae). The opening of the buds, and the appear* \\nance of the leaves, is called Foliation, (foliatw). \\nThis is occasioned by the fall of the outer covers, \\nwhich consist of small imbricated scales. In plants \\nthat have no buds, the foliation takes place imme- \\ndiately from the bark. In different plants at folia- \\ntion, the young leaves are variously folded up. When \\nan opening bud is cut over horizontally, the follow** \\ning varieties appear : \\n1.

When the leaves are opposite, the figure is \\noften doubled, as in fig. 258, 259, 268, 262. \\nWith regard to figure, the bud is very various, but \\nthe varieties are easily discriminated ; the following \\nkinds however may be distinguished : \\n1. Simple (simplex), when the bud stands solitary \\nas in most trees and shrubs. \\n2. Aggregate (aggregata), when a number stand \\nclose together as in Zanthoxylum fraxmeum. \\n3.

The pappus remains constantly \\ntill the ripening of the seed, and we shall consider \\nit more fully when treating of the seed, {§ 117). \\nFig. 84, 86, 87. \\nf 80. \\nThe Mosses have a peculiar calyx, differently form- \\ned from that of other plants, called perichaetium. \\nThe flowers of Mosses are so small that they cannot \\nbe seen without the help of a high magnifier. In \\ngeneral they are of different sexes, that is, some are \\nintirely male, others female flowers. The calyx of \\nthe female flower remains till the fruit is ripe and \\nappears at the base of the seta. (J 26). The male \\nflower is only visible with a high magnifier, and dis- \\nappears after the fructification is completed. \\nIn the male flowers the calyx consists of a num- \\nber of leaves, which differ from the other leaves in \\nbeing of a finer structure, and of another form. \\nThe calyx of the female flower is best seen \\\\vhen \\nthe fruit is ripe, when it is observed at the base of \\nthe seta (J 26), fig. 140. and consists of a number of \\nimbricated leaves, which are distinguished from those \\nof the Moss by their length or breadth. These \\nleaves lie thick upon one another, and the whol^ is \\n©f a conical form. \\ne 4 \\n\\n104 \\nPIvINClPLES OF LOIAHY, ETC \\n§ 81. \\nThe COROLLA is the envelope, or small leaves in- \\nclosed by the calyx, surrounding the interior parts \\nof the flower, of a more delicate structure than the \\ncalyx, and of another colour than green. It consists \\neither of one piece or of several ; the first is called \\na monopetalous corolla, (corolla monopetala), the \\nlast polypetalous, ( corolla j^lypetala ). The pieces \\nit consists of are called petals, (petala). \\n$ 82. \\nThe MONOPETALOUS COROLLA is that which con- \\nsists but of one pieoc, which, however, may be di- \\nvided into segments, but which must always be in- \\ntire at the base. The following are varieties of this \\ncorolla : \\n1. Tubular, {Hihulosa), that consists of a single \\npiece, hollow and of equal thickness. The small \\ncorolla or floret, which is found included in a com- \\nmon perianthium is also called tubular, although it \\nsometimes departs from this form, fig. 60, 86, 275. \\n2. Club-shai)ed, {cla7)afa), which forms a tube, \\ngrowing gradually wider upwards, and narrower at \\nthe aperture, fig. 276. \\n3. Spherical, {globosa), which is narrow above \\nand below, and wide in the middle, fig. 268. \\n4. Bell-shaped, {cainpanulata), that grows gra- \\ndually wider to the mouth, so that it has nearly the \\nappearance of a bell, fig. 62. \\n5. Cup-shaped, (cyathifornm), when a cylindrical \\ntube grows gradually wider from below upwards, \\n\\nTERMINOLOGY. \\n105 \\nbut the margin is upright and not bent back or con- \\ntracted, fig. 273, 82. \\n6. Urceolated, (urccolata), when a short cylin- \\ndrical tube extends itself into a wide surface, ths \\nmargin of which is erect, fig. 274. \\n7. Funnel-shaped, {inf undibuHformis), when the \\ntube of the corolla grows gradually wide above, that \\nis, obversely conical, but the rim pretty flat and \\nturned outwards, fig. 269- \\n8. Salver-shaped, {Jiypocrateriformis)^ when the \\ntube of the corolla is perfectly cylindrical but very \\nlong, and the rim forms a broad expansion, fig. 267, \\nas in Phlox. \\n9. Wheel-shaped, {rot at a), «^hen a cylindrical \\ntube is very short, nearly shorter than the calyx, \\nsometimes hardly perceptible, and its margin is \\nquite flat. It is almost the same with the foregoing, \\nonly the tube is very short, as in Shepherd\\'s club, \\nVerbascum. \\n10. Tongue-shaped, {ligulata), when the tube is \\nnot long, suddenly ceases, and ends in an oblong \\nexpansion, as in the Aristolochia Ckviatitis, fig. 271, \\nand in some flowers that are contained in a common \\nperianthium, fig. 84. \\n11. Difform, (diffbrmis), when the tube gradually \\nbecomes wider above, and is divided into unequal \\nlobes, as in some corollas that are included in a \\ncommon perianthium, e. g. the bluebottle, Centaurea \\nCyanus, fig. 61. \\n12. Ringent, {rlngejis), when the margin of a \\ntubular corolla is divided into two parts, of which \\nthe upper part is arched, the under oblong, and has \\n6 \\n\\n106 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nsome resemblance to the open mouth of an animal, \\nas in sage, Salvia officinalis, fig. 72. \\n15. Masked, (personata), when both segments of \\nthe ringent flower are closely pressed together, as in \\nsnapdragon, Antirrhinum majus, fig. 49- \\n14. Bilabiate, (bilabiata), when the corolla has \\ntwo segments or lips which lie over against each \\nother, and which are themselves often laciniated or \\ncleft, fig. 272. \\n15. One-lipped, (unilahiata), when in a ringent, \\npersonate, &c. corolla, the upper or under lip is \\nwanting, as in Teucrium, fig. 50 and 51: \\nf 83. \\nThe kinds of the many-petalled corolla, \\n{coj^olla polypetala), are, \\n1. Rose-like, {rosacea), when petals, which are \\npretty round, and at their base have no unguis, form \\na corolla, fig. 150, 195. \\n2. Mallow-like, {malmcea), when five petals, \\nwhich at the base are considerably attenuated, so \\nunite below that they appear to be monopetalous, \\nfig. 56. \\n3. Cross-like, (cruciafa), when four petals which \\nare very much produced at their base, stand opposite \\nto one another, as in Sinapis alba, Brassica olera- \\ncea, \"ciridis, ^c. fig. 145. \\n4.

Lily-like, (lUiacea), when there are six pe-* \\ntals but no calyx. In some there are only three, in \\nothers they form a tube at the bottom. This makes \\nthe idea somewhat indefinite ; but it ought to be re- \\nmarked, that this kind of corolla never has a calyx \\nand that it is only proper to the lilies, {§ 125), \\n% 66, 71, 146. \\n6. Two, three, four, five, &c. many pe tailed, {dif \\ntri, tetra, penta, 8^c. poli/jjetala), thus the corolla is \\ndenominated according to the number of the petals. \\n7. Papilionaceous, ( papiiionacea), when four pe- \\ntals difFeiing in figure, stand together ; to these pe- \\ntals the following names have been given : (for in- \\nstances, examine the flowers of the common pea, \\nPisum sativum, or vetch, Vicia sativa, fig. 105, 30.) \\na. The standard, {ve.villum)^ is the uppermost \\npetal, which is commonly the largest, and is \\nsomewhat concave, fig. 106. \\nh. The two wings, {alae), are the two petals \\nwhich stand under the vexillum, and oppo- \\nsite to each other on each side, fig. 107. \\nc. The keel, {carina), is the undermost petal ; \\nit is hollow, and stands under the vexillum, \\nand opposite to it ; and contains the germen, \\nwith the stamina and pistillum, fig. 108. \\n8. Orchideous, (orchidca), is a corolla composed \\nof five petals, of which the undermost is long and \\nsometimes cleft ; the other four are arched and bent \\ntowards one another, fig. 33. \\n9. Irregular, (irregularis), consisting of four or \\nmore petals, which are of different lengths and in- \\n\\nlOS PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nclination, so that they do not come under the de- \\nscription of the other kinds, fig. 1 34. \\n§ 84. \\nA single division of the corolla as we observed \\n81) is called a petal, (petahm); when this is plane^ \\nthe upper part is called lamina, the under part un- \\nguis. \\nThe particular parts of the corolla have beside^ \\nappropriate names. The following are those of the \\nMONOPETALOUS COROLLA : \\n1. The tube, {tubus), of a monopetalous corolla is \\nthe under part, which is hollow, and in general of \\nequal thickness. All flowers with this kind of co- \\nrolla have a tube, except the bell-shaped, and some- \\ntimes the wheel-shaped. \\n2. The border, {iinihus), is the opening of the co- \\nrolla, especially when it is bent back, 82, No. \\n1 — 1 ]). The limbus is often dentated or deeply di- \\nvided, and the divisions are called, \\n3. Segments or lobes, (Jaciniae s. lohi), and they \\nare denominated according to their figure, number, \\nand situation. \\n4. The helmet, (galea), is the upper arched la- \\ncinia of a ^ ringent or masked corolla, which is fur- \\nther denominated according to its situation, fio-ure, \\nand segments or laciniae. \\n5. The gape, (riclus), is, in ringent flowers, the \\nspace between the two extremities of the helmet and \\nthe under lip. \\n6. The throat, {fatLv), in a monopetalous and \\nringent corollU) is the opening of the tube. \\n\\n•TERMINOLOGT. \\n109 \\n7. The palate, (palatum)^ in a personate corolla is \\nthe arch of the under iip, which is so elevated as to \\nclose the faux. \\n8. The he-eixd, {harha s. labeUuin), is the under lip \\nof a ringent and personate corolla. \\n9. The lips, {labia), in the bilabiate and unila- \\nbiate flowers, are the two divisions, the one called \\nthe upper lip, {labium supcrius), and the other the \\nunder lip, {labiim injerius). The galea and barba \\nare likewise by some botanists called lips. \\n\\\\ 85? \\nThe corolla of the Mosses differs in external ap- \\npearance from that of all other plants. It has this \\nremarkable peculiarity, that after flowering it remains \\ntill the ripening of the fruit, but then appears under \\na quite different form. The female flower alone is \\nfurnished with a corolla. It consists of a pretty hard \\nmembrane that closely embraces the pistillum. It is \\nfastened both above and below, and thus after \\nflowering it must be detached and be designated by \\nvarious names. The under part perfectly resembles \\nthe vagina on the straw of the Grasses, and is in- \\nclosed by the poichaetium ; it is called a litde sheath, \\n{vaginula). The upper part remains attached to the \\ntop of the fruit, and is called Calyptre, {ca/yptra). \\nThe varieties of the calyptra shew themselves only \\n^hen the fruit is ripe, and these we shall mentioft \\nparticularly afterwards, {§ 113). \\n\\n110 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC \\n§ 86. \\nAnother important part of the flower is the nec- \\ntary, {nectarium). Linnaeus comprehends in this \\nall those bodies which have no resemblance to the \\nother parts of the flower, in whatever variety of \\nforms they may appear. These bodies, however, do \\nnot all secrete a sweet juice {nectar), and therefore \\ndo not all deserve the name of Nectarium. I shall \\nin the mean time preserve this established name, and \\ndistinjfuish the various kinds by their functions. \\nNectaria may be divided into three kinds; 1. such \\nas really secrete a sweet juice or honey ; 2. such as \\nserve for the preservation of it ; and 3. those which \\nprotect the true secretory organs or stamina, and also \\nserve for promoting the impregnation. \\n? 87. \\nNectaria, which really secrete and exude honev, \\nare glands (gia)idulae), or nectariferous scales or \\npores, {squamae nectar\\'iferae, port nectariferi). Of \\nglands, there are the following varieties : \\nJ. Sitting, {sessilis), which is not elevated on a \\nfoot-stalk, as in Sinapis, Brassica, &c. fig. 148. \\n2. Petiolated, {petiolata), which is furnished with \\na foot- stalk. \\n5. Spherical, {globosa). \\n4. Compressed, {compressa), which is flat on both \\nsides. \\n5. Flat, (plana), that is scarcely convex, as in \\ncrown imperial; Fritillaria imperialism \\n\\nTERMINOLOGY. \\nIll \\n6. Oblong, (oblo7iga), that is besides of a long \\nform. \\n7. Cup- shaped, {cyathiform\\'is), that in form of a \\ncup embraces the germen. When the seeds are \\nripe it changes into a hard, green body, as in the \\nplants of the class Didynamia Gymnospermia, As- \\nperifoliae, \\' &c. tig. 74*. \\nThe squamae nectar \\'iferae arc small scales that ex- \\nude honey, vvhich is found in small holes, as in Ra- \\nnunculus. The small scales often secrete no honey, \\nand are then called simply scales {squamae). \\nThe Pori ifectarifen are small holes or pits exud- \\ning honey, and which are seen on different parts of \\nthe flower, as in iiyacintlius orientalis, &c. \\nJ 88. \\nOf tl>e Nectaria, so called, \\\\vhich are destined for \\nthe reception and preservation of honey, there are \\nthe following kinds ; mz. The hood, {cucullus) ; the \\ntube, {tubvs) ; the pit, { fovea) ; the fold, {plica) ; \\nthe spur, {calcar). \\nThe HOOD, {cucullus), is a hollow body like a bag \\nor hood, that is quite separated from all the other \\nparts of the flovver, and has commonly a short foot- \\nstalk, as in monkshood, Aconitum^ iig. 135, ]9<5- \\nIn some flowers there are such hood-like bodies, \\nwhich contain no honey, as in Asclepias V\\'mceto.vi\\' \\n^uMf fig. Si;. \\n* The glands arc situated ou every part of the flower, on the \\ncalyx, the corolla, the stamina and the pistillum. The glands \\nalouc secrete a honey juice. \\n\\n112 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nThe tube, (tubus), is a part of the flower that \\n}ias perfectly the shape of a cyHnder, and therefore \\namong most botanists goes by the name. It is con- \\nstanlly attached to the flower, as in African cranes- \\nbill, Pelargonium, &c. fig. 306; 307. \\nThe PIT, (fovea), is a cavity for the reception of \\nhoney, situated either in the calyx, the corolla, or \\nin some other part of the flower, as in Hyptis, &c. \\nThe FOLD, (plica), is an oblong groove, formed \\nby the bending inwards of the corolla, which some- \\ntimes happens. \\nThe SPUR, (calcar), is a horn-shaped production \\nof the corolla in which honey is found. Sometimes \\nin the pointed part of the spur there is a gland \\nwhich contains honey, but sometimes it is secreted \\nin another part, and thence flows into the spur, as \\nin the March violet, Viola odorata ; Indian cress, \\nTropaeolum viajus, fig. 4P, 112, 113. \\nI 89. \\nAll these parts of the flower may with propriety \\nbe called Nectaria ; but some that are commonly \\ncalled by the name are very diiTerent. Certainly \\nthose parts which serve for the protection of the \\nnectarious juice, or of the pollen, or for the ad- \\nvancement of the fructification, deserve at least the \\nname of reservoirs of honey. Such are the Fornlvy \\nthe Barha, the Filum, the Cylindrus, and the Co- \\nrona. \\nThe Arch, (forniv), is a small elongation of the \\ncorolla, whkh commonly covers the stamina, or is \\nseated at the aperture of the corolla. Its form is \\n\\nTERMINOLOGY. \\n113 \\nvery various, as in comfrey, Sympbytiini ojfldnakj \\nBorago, mouse-ear, Myosotis scorpioides, 8cc. tig. \\n81. \\nThe BEAKD, (barha), consists of a number of \\nshort hairs or soft bristles which are situated at the \\nopenmg of the calyx or corolla ; or on the petals, \\nor at the bottom of the flower, as in Thymus, Iris, \\nPeriploca, &c. fig. 71, <*0, 9% 114- \\nThe THREAD, (filiim)j is a long thick body of a \\ntender substance, and found very numerous in the \\nbottom of the flower.

Under these divisions all the Nectaria of Lin- \\nnaeus may be properly arranged and accurately de^ \\ntermined. In some flowers, particularly the Ascle- \\npias, there appear small cartilaginous bodies, which \\nare commonly called Tubercula, and seem to be im- \\nperfect or dried up glands. \\nThe Nectaria of the Grasses appear very like the \\nglume, but are distinguished by their extraordinary \\nfineness. They are quite transparent, and very \\ntender. \\nThe plants which bear catkins, (amenta), have \\nlikewise Nectaria, which are generally called squa- \\nmae. They serve sometimes for the preservation of \\nthe honey, sometimes for other purposes. \\nIn the flowers of Mosses there have hitherto been \\nno traces of Nectaria discovered ; we find, how^ever, \\nin these flowers transparent, articulated bodies, which \\nhave been called succulent filaments, (Jila succuleii\\' \\ntaj, and which perhaps answer the purposes of Nec- \\ntaria, fig. 127, 130, 131, 133. \\nThe Stamens, (stamina), are one of the essential \\nparts of the flower, and are long bodies which con- \\ntain a quantity of dust or powder essential to the \\nfructification. \\nThe parts o^ the stamina are three, the filament, \\n{Jilamentum), the anther, {anthera), and the poiv- \\nder, {pollen). \\n\\nTERM INOr OCT. \\n115 \\n§9U \\nThe FILAMENT, {Jilmncntum)^ is a longish body \\nthat is destined for the support and elevation of the \\nanther.

Two, three, four, &c. multifid, (hi, tri quadri, \\nSec. multijidus ), cleft in a determined manner. \\n8. Dichotomous, (dichotomus), divided into two \\nparts, wliich are again divided at the points. \\n* When wc speak of the situation of tlie gcrmen, we must \\nbe understood to mean its situation with respect to the calyx, \\nfor there may be instances of the gormen being encircled by \\ntlie calyx, and yet being situaled below the corolla. It is on- \\nly in absence of the calyx that the situation is determined by \\nthe other parts. Germen inferum is also expressed by Flos \\nepiciD\\'pius^ or Tlos superus ; and Germeit ittferum by Flot \\nhj/pec(vpiutf or Flos infcrus. -f- .\\'f/\\' \\n\\nTERMIXOLOGY. 121 \\n5).

The length of the style, whether lonijer \\nor shorter than the stamina, is also to be mentioned. \\n^ 97. \\nThe STiGiiA means the top of the style. The \\nkinds of it are as follows : \\n1. Pointed, (acutum), when it is a sharp point. \\n2. Blunt, (obtmum), when it forms a blunt point. \\n3. Oblong, (obknigiwi), when it is thick and elon- \\ngated. \\n4.

Sitting, (sessile), which when there is no style \\nrests on the germen. \\nThe stigma, properly speaking, consists of a num- \\nber of inhaling tubercles, which are not always visi- \\nble without a magnifier. In the Mirabilis Jalapa \\nthey are to be seen most distinctly. \\nThe pistillum of Mosses is furnished with a ger- \\nmen, stylus, and stigma, like other plants. But in \\nthis tribe there are several pistilla, some only of \\nwhich form perfect fruit, the others are barren: \\nthese last are called Adductores. The Equsietum has \\nno style, neither have the other Filices and Fungi. In \\nthe Filices, the pistillum has the appearance of asmall \\ngrain, so likewise that of the Fungi, only in this it is \\ndrawn together like a small net. In all these plants the \\nparts can be observed only by means of a high magnifier. \\nWhen plants have done flowering there proceeds \\nfrom the germen (J 95) the fruit, (fructus.) This \\nis either naked seeds, (semen), or a skin, hard shell, \\nor other substance containmg the seeds, called \\npericarp, (pericarpium), lOOj. Thus all plants \\nmay be brought under two great divisions, name- \\nly, such as have naked seeds, ( vegetabilia gymno- \\n\\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\napcrmia), that is to say, such \\\\vhere the gcrmeil \\nchanges into one or more naked seeds : and such \\nas have their seeds covered, (vcgetab\\'dia angmjjct*- \\nmia ), or those whose gertnen changes into a peri- \\ncarpium. Of the lirst kind, namely the naked seed- \\ned plants, there have yet been discovered only four \\nvarieties, viz. \\n1. One-seetled, (vegciahilia monospcrma), where \\nthe single germen is one naked seed. \\n2. Two-seeded, ( disperma J, w hen out of two or \\none germen in a flower there proceed two naked \\nseeds. \\n3. Four-secdea, , telrasperma), when four germi- \\nna or one four-partitioned germen in a flower change \\nto four naked seeds. \\n4. Many-seeded, (polysperma ), when out of seve- \\nral germina in one flower there proceed several naked \\nseeds. \\nThe parts of the pericarpium and the seed are \\nsubject to much variation, which we shall exemplify \\nin the following paragraphs. \\n\\\\ 100. \\nThe PEiiiCARnuAi is a cavity of various figure, \\ncontaining seeds. The kinds of it are, Utricidus, \\nSavuirn, FolUculiis, Capsula, Nilv, Drupa, Bacca, \\nPomii??i, FepOf Siiujua, Lcgumen, Lomcniiim, and \\nllieca. \\n§ 101. \\nThe BLADDER, ( utriculus), couaists of a thin skin. \\n\\nTERMINOLOGY. 125 \\nvhich incloses a single seed. The kinds of it are \\nthese, \\n1. Loose, (la.vits)^ that holds the seed inclosed \\nquite loose, as in Adonis, Thalictruin, fig. lf>5, 166. \\n2. Strait ( St rictus), that quite closely surrounds \\nthe seed, as in ladies bedstraw, Galium. \\n3. Cut round, ( circvmsiissus), that bursts in the \\nmiddle, and detaches itself, as in Ainaranthus. \\nN. The Utriculus is distinguished from the ex- \\nterior coat of the seed by this, that between the seed \\nand the external coat there is a space, and that the \\nseed is connected with it by the umbilical chord. \\nThe utriculus differs from the nut in beins; less hard \\nand more yielding. \\n§ 102. \\nThe WINGED-FRUIT, (samara), is a pericarpiura, \\nwhich contains one or at most two seeds, and is sur- \\nrounded by a thin, transparent membrane, either in \\nits whole circumference, or at the point, or even on \\nthe side. Examples of this are seen in the fruit of \\nthe elm, ulimis, fig. KiS, l63 ; mapple, fleer; ash, \\nfrad-imis ; birch, hctula ; and many others. The \\nkinds of it are determined by the number of the \\nseeds, whether there be one or two in the fruit, or \\naccording to the place to which the thin membrane \\nis attached, which is called the wing, (ala). \\n§ 103. \\nThe FOLLICLE, (folUculvs), is an oblong pericar- \\noium, which bursts longitudinally on one side, and \\nis filled with seeds. The follicle is seldom single^ \\n\\n126 \\nPRINCirLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nthere are generally two together. Its varieties are \\ndetermined accordins to the attachment of the seed ; \\n■when, for example, there is a partition in the middle \\nto which the seed is fixed ; or when it is attached to \\nboth^sutures at which this fruit bursts ; as in As- \\nclepias syriaca, Vinca, Oleander, &c. fig. 170. \\n} 104. \\nThe CAPSULE, (capsula), is a pericarpium, con- \\nsisting of a thin coat which contains many seeds, \\noften divided into cells, and assuming various forms. \\nThe parts of the capsule are the following : \\na. The partition, ( dissepimmtum), is a firm mem- \\nbrane that intersects and divides the inner \\ncavity of the capsule. \\nb. The cells, ( loculamenta ), are the spaces be- \\ntween the partitions. \\nc. The columella is a filiform body that passes \\nthrough the middle of the Capsule, and to \\nwhich the partitions are attached, fig. \\nH. The valves, ( mlvulae ), form the outward \\ncoat of the Capsule, which bursts longitu- \\ndinally in several parts. \\ne. The suture, (sutura)^ is a deep furrow which \\nappears on the outside of the coat. \\nThe difl\\'erent sorts of capsules are distinguished \\naccording as they are round, long, &c. and further, \\naccording as they are, \\n1. Unilocular, (miilocularisj, when there are no \\ndivisions. \\n\\nTERiriNOLOGT, \\n127 \\n2.

They have over the \\nCapsule a thin, light, deciduous membrane called \\ncalyptre, (calyptra). The Capsule bursts in four or \\ntwo valves, (quadri- vel bivalvisj, fig. .227, or it \\nopens with a number of teeth at the apex ; as iu \\nMarchantia. \\n6 \\n\\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nThe Filices present but three varieties in their cap- \\nsule. \\n1. Bivalve, (bivalvis), when it opens in two valves \\nand is quite smooth ; fig. 129^. \\n2.

Separating by a cleft, (rivm dchi.sce??s ), when \\nit opens from above in a small chink, fig. 303. \\n§ 105. \\nThe NUT, (nux), is a seed covered with a hard \\nshell which does not burst ; as the hazle-nut, Cory- \\nlus A-vdUuia, the oak, Quercus rohur, the hemp, Can- \\nnabis safiva, ficr. 205. The shell is called Putamen \\nand described according as it is hard ( dvrinn), or \\nbrittle (Jragile). The seed contained in the nut is \\ncalled the kernel (nucleus). We remark likewise \\nwhether the nut is two or three-seeded, ( hi, vel tri- \\nsperma), or whether it is divided into cells, naniely, \\ntwo, three, or many-celled, (bi^ tri, wei viu!iilocu- \\nlaris ). \\nThe DiujPF., (drupaj, is a nut \\\\\\\\ hif:his covered \\nwith a thiek, flesh}\\', succulent or cartilaginous coat. \\nThe follou ing are its varieties : \\n1.

One, two, three, four nutted, &c. ( mono, bi, \\ntri, tetrapi/rena ), which contains one, two, three or \\nfour nuts. But if the hard shell of the nut grows \\nto the kernel, it is called a pyrenous berry. \\nIn accurate description we must attend to the \\nfigure of the nut, as well as to its cells. The nut \\nof the Drupa has sometimes two, three, or more \\ncells, fig. 171, 172, 173. \\nI 107. \\nThe BERRY, (bacca J, is a succulent fruit which \\ncontains several seeds, and never bursts.

Internally the seeds are at- \\ntached to the margin of the partition on both sides \\nof the suture, the upper as well as the under, e. g. \\nin the mustard, ^\\'mnpis alba, cabbage, Brassica o/era- \\ncea, c^T. fig. 190, 191. When the Siliqua is as \\nbroad as it is long, it is called silicle (silicula), fig \\n187, 188, as in the garden cress, Lepidium ifati- \\nvtim ; shepherd\\'s purse, Thlaspi Bursa pastoris. The \\nSiliqua is distiniynished accordiu\"; to the situation of \\nthe partition, (dissepimaUum). When both valves \\nof this pericarpium are flat, and the partition, whieh \\nreaches from one suture to the other, is of equal \\nbreadth, we say the valves run parallel with the par- \\ntition, fvalvulis disscpiiiiento jmralklis). liut if \\nb:)ih vftlves are swelled and hollow, so that tlie two \\nsutures stand in the centre of the pericarp, and the \\npartition is much narrower than the greatest breadth \\nof the fruit, we say, the valves run contrary to tJie \\npartition, ( valvtilis dissepimtMo contmriis J. Many \\nvarieties take place in the figure of the Siliqua \\n* Of the Siliculae, there are some which have a double shell, \\nthe exterior softer and spongy, the interior harder, which cob- \\ntains the seed, iaclosed in cells.

In- \\nternally it is divided into cells by small transverse \\npartitions, which contain only one seed attached to \\nthe under suture. It never bursts longitudinally, like \\nthe two former pericarps ; but when it opens, the \\npartitions detach themselves in small pieces. The \\nkinds of this pericarp are the following: \\n1. ( ortical, (corticosum), when the outer shell is \\nvery hard and woody, but the internal cavities are \\nfilled with a soft substance, as in Cassia Fistula, fig. \\n\\'i9% 194. \\n2. Articulated, (articnlatum), when the transverse \\npartitions appear distinctly on the outside, and are \\neasily divided into joints, as in Hedysarum. \\n3. Intercepted with isthmuses, (isthmis intercej)- \\ntiim)^ w hen the transverse partitions are easily seen, \\nand also easily separate, but the cells are much small- \\ner than the articulations, as in Hippocrepis j\\'. \\n* There are still other kinds, which arc named according \\nto their figure, and according as the surface is set with hairs, \\nbristles, M ingSj points, or prickles. \\nf It is not the transverse partition that distingnislies the lo- \\nment from the legume : the principal character of the loment \\nconsists in its not separating longitudinally into two halves, \\nbut either not opening at all or being detached in small pieces. \\n\\nTERMINOLOGY. \\n135 \\n§ 113. \\nThe CASE, (theca), is the fruit of the fiondose \\nMusci.

The Epiphragm, (epipliragiim), is a thin \\nmembrane, which stretches over the mouth of \\nthe theca ; it is found only in the genus Poly- \\ntrichum, fig. 17(j. \\nF. The Seed- column, (sporangidium s. colim- \\nnula ), is a slender, thread-like body, that pas- \\nses through the middle of the theca, and to \\nwhich the seed is attached. It is analogous \\nto that body which in a capsule is called by \\nthe same name. \\nG. The Apophysis is a fleshy, round, or oblong \\nbody, that appeal s at the base of the theca. \\nSometimes it is very small, and almost imper- \\nceptible; sometimes, however, larger than the \\ntheca itself, fig. 1 76, 1 79- \\nIn one genus of Musci (the Phascum), tlie oper; \\nculum never separates from the theca : but as soon \\nas the seed is ripe, the whole theca falls off. As no \\nmouth can be seen in this Moss, it is said to be with- \\nout one (peristommn nullum). \\n\\n138 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\n§ 114. \\nIn the Fungi the capsules are hidden in the sub- \\nstance of tlie gills, pores, prickles or papillae, or \\nwhere these are wanting, in the fleshy substance. \\nThe capsules open at the top and disperse the seeds \\nin the form of very slender fibres. In the genus \\nPeziza, there are eight seeds in a capsule, fig. 286, 287- \\nIn some species of the same genus the seeds are in- \\ncluded by twos in one membrane, anti there are eight \\nof these double seeds in one capsule, fig. ^S3, 284. \\nDifferent genera of Tungi, and among others the \\nLycoperdon, have numerous seeds, which compose \\ntheir whole inner substance, fig. 7- \\n§ 115. \\nAccording to the explan-ition given § 99, the fruit \\nis that part which is formed from the germen, whe- \\nther it change into naked seeds or into a pericarpium. \\nThe botanist can never form a proper judgement of \\nany fruit till he is acquainted with the mode of its \\nproduction. The calyx, the corolla, the nectarium, \\nthe receptacle, may alter flowering envelope the ger- \\nmen, may grow with it, and thus form a particular \\nsort of fruit that may have the appearance of a peri- \\ncarpium without being one. Such a production is \\ncalled a false fruit, (friictus spiiriiis ). Some of these, \\non account of their resemblance, have got the name \\nof that sort of pericarp which, without accurate in- \\nvestigation, they most nearly resemble. Others have \\ngot peculiar names ; for instance, \\n\\nTERMINOLOGY. \\n139 \\n1. The Strobile, (strohilus), is a catkin, (§40.), the \\nscales of which have become woody, and, according \\nto the nature of the plants, contain one or two loose \\nseeds, or even nuts, under each scale. The whole \\nhas the appearance of a particular sort of fruit. The \\nkinds of the strohilus are, \\na. Cylindrical, (cylbidriciis), fig. 193. \\n/S Conical, (conicus). \\ny. Ovate, ( oxatus). \\n^. Spherical, (glubosiis), &c. \\n2. The false capsule, ( capsula spuria ). The Beech, \\nTagus sykaiica bears such. The proper fruit of this \\ntree are two three-cornered nuts that stand close to- \\ngether, and are encompassed by a coricaceous prick- \\nly calyx, which has the appearance of an unilocular, \\nfour vaived capsule, \\'ihe dock, Rumex, bears but \\na single seed, which the abiding calyx surrounds like a \\ncapsule. The Carex bears one seed, which is en- \\nclosed by the nectaiium, and thus acquires a capsule- \\nlike form. \\n3. The false nut, (jiilv spuria). The Trapa na- \\nta?is, has a sintrie seed which is attached to the \\ncalyx, the foliola of which change into a hard nut- \\nshell with four spines. The Coix Lachryma Jobi, \\nhas a single seed, enclosed however by the calyx and \\ncorolla, and becomes hard and shining like a stone. \\nThe Mirabilis Jalapa, retains the under part of the \\ntube of the corolla, which grows with the seed, and \\nforms a nut. \\n4. The false drupa, (drupa spuria). The yew, \\nTaxus baccata, bears a nut that is half sunk in the \\nfleshy receptacle, and thus appears like a drupa. \\n\\n140 \\nrUINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nThis is the case likewise with the Anacardium and \\nSemicarpus, (§ 117. \\n5. The false berry, (hacca spuria)- The juniper, \\nJuniperus comnnuus, has a catkin, 40.), and must \\nregularly bear a strobilus ; but tlie scales grow toge- \\nther, become fleshy, and assume ihe appearance of a \\nberry. I\\'he straw berry. Fragaria vesca, bears de- \\ntached seeds upon a fleshy receptacle, and looks like \\na berry, (J 119.)- The JBasella encloses its seeds in \\nthe calyx and corolla, which become fleshy, and thus \\nhas the appearance of a perfect berry. \\nMore examples of this kind may be learned by at- \\ntentive observation. \\nWith regard to the Strobilus it remains to be no- \\nticed, that we often falsely so call the scaly imbri- \\ncated seeds of the tulip-tree, Liriodendron tulipi- \\nfera, and the imbricated capsules of the ]\\\\lagnolia, \\nfig. 159. But the Strobilus proceeds only from a \\ncatkin. \\n§ 116. \\nThe SEED, ( semen), is that part of the plant which \\nis destined to its propagation. It consists of two \\nhalves, which change at germination into leaves, and \\nare called seed-leaves or cotyledons, ( cotyledoncs ) . \\nBetween these, on one side, lies the corcle, (coixu- \\nlum), which consists of two bodies, one sharp-point- \\ned, which descends into the earth, and becomes a \\nroot, rostel, (rostelluyn) ; the other ascending, and des- \\ntined afterwards to form the stem and leaves, called \\nplumule, (plumula). The seed besides is covered with \\na double integument, the outer one being thick and \\n\\nTERMlISrOLOGY. \\n141 \\nof a firm consistence, tlie inner transparent and ten- \\nder. Tlie external one is called the external tunic, \\n( tunica externa the inner, the internal membrane, \\n(membrana interna). The place in the seed which \\nis occupied by the corculum may be seen externally, \\nas it is marked by a deep impression called the eye, \\nor external scar, ( h\\'llum)\\' The seed, till it has at- \\ntained its full ripeness, is fastened by a small tiiread \\ncalled tiie umbilical cord, (funiculus umbilicalis). \\nPlants have been divided accoi^din^ to the various \\nways in which the seed germinates ; viz- such as \\nhave no seed-leaves are called acotyledonous, ( acoty- \\niedones) ; such as have one, tw o, or more seed-leaves, \\nare called monocotyledonous, &c. (mono, di, poltjco- \\ntylcdones). But an accurate observation of nature \\nshows the above division to be inept. In what dif- \\nferent ways seeds germinate will be shown in the \\nPhysiology. \\nThe forms of the seed are very various, but they \\nare easily distinguished- 15y means of the umbilical \\ncord, seeds are attached, in the pericarpium, either \\nto the rim, to the receptacle, to the inner surface, to \\nthe valves, &c. ; but when they are found so close in \\na berry that their attachment cannot easily be seen, \\nthey are said to be nidulant seeds, ( semina nidulan- \\ntia ). The substance of seeds is firm, and we have \\nbut few examples of soft seeds. Linnaeus some- \\ntimes speaks of two- celled seeds, (semina hitocula- \\nria) ; but such can no more occur in nature than \\n\\n142 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\neggs with two cells ; what Linnaeus thus calls, are \\ngenerally two-celled nuts \\n§ ur- \\nTo the seed and to the pericarp belong yet other \\norgans, which contribute to the accurate knowledge \\nof plants. These parts are the Arillm, the Pappus, \\nthe Desma, the Cauda, the Rostrum, the Ala, the \\nCrista, the Costa, the Verruca, the Prui?ia, the \\nElater, the CapiUitium, and the Trichidium. \\n1. The AiiiLLUs is a soft membrane extended over \\nthe seed ; it is called, \\na. Succulent, (succulenius, baccatus, s. carno- \\nsiLS ), when it is thick and flesiiy, as in the \\nspindle-tree, Euonymus europatus. \\nh. Cartilaginous, ( cartilagineus), when it is of a \\nfirm consistence, and thick. \\nc. Membranaceous, ( membranaccus ), when it \\nconsists of a thin, transparent tunicle. \\nd. Halved, (dimidiatus), when only the half of \\nthe seed has a covering. \\n€. Torn, (lacerus), when the arillus is irregular- \\nly laciniated, fig. 20G. \\n/. Caped, ( califptratus), when it covers the top \\nof the seed, as the calyptra surrounds the \\nthe top of the theca in Mosses, (J 1 13). \\n* In the animal kingdom there has indeed been discovered a \\nleech, (hirudo octoculato ), which produces one egg, and from \\nthis proceed eight, ten, or more young. But it may be ques- \\ntioned whether this is really a single egg, or -whether it is not \\nseveral connected together by some mucilaginous matter. la, \\nplants there is uo instance of this known to me \\n\\nTERMINOLOGY. \\n143 \\ng. Net-like, { reticiilatus), when it closely em- \\nbraces the seed like a fine web. Examples \\nof this are found in the species of Orcliis, \\nand particularly in all vecy small seeds. In \\nthese plants the seeds are enclosed as in a \\nbag*. \\n2. The PAPPUS is the calyx of each particular flo- \\nret enclosed in a common perianth, 77-) During \\nthe time of flowering, the papjnis is in most plants so \\nvery small that its distinguishing characters cannot \\nwell be observed ; when the seed ripens it attains its \\nperfection, and then exhibits the following varieties : \\na. Sitting, ( sessilh ), when the pappus sits on the \\nthe top of the seed, without any foot-stalk, \\n%. 189. \\nb. Stipitate, f stipifatus J, when it is supported on \\na pedicle, fig. 185, 186. \\nc.

Calycled, ( calyculatus s. marg\\'matus), when \\na membranaceous rim rises over the seed : \\nthis is either, \\n«. Whole, (integer) J when the rim is not in- \\ndented, and surrounds the top of the \\nseed, as in Tanacetum, Dipsacus ; or, \\n* The Arillus docs not surround the seeds alone; sometimes \\nit even encloses the pericarpium, as in the nutmeg, Myristica \\ntnoschaia; what is called mace is an arillus which surround* \\nthe fruit, fig. 206. \\n\\\\ \\n\\n/ \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\n/S. Halved, (dimidiatus), when the rim sur- \\nrounds only the half of the top of the \\nseed. \\n/. Chaffy, (paleaceus), when small leaves like \\nscales stand round the top of the seed, as \\nin the sun-flower, Helianthus annuus, and \\nmany others. This chaffy pappus consists \\nof two, three, five, or more leaves, ( di, trh \\npenta, vol polijphyllus) ; the foliola are \\nlanceolate, obtuse, or setaceous. \\ng. Awned, ( aristahis), when one, two, or even \\nthree, but never more, straight setae stand \\nround the top of the seed, as in Bidens \\ntripartita. \\nh. Stellate, (stelUitus), when five long- pointed \\nbristles are s-pread like a star bn the top of \\nthe seed. \\ni. Hair-like, ( capillaris s. piloms ), when many \\nvery fine, and commonly shining, white, \\nsimple hairs stand on the crown of the \\nseed, fig. 186. \\nk. Setaceous, fsetacens), when many rigid \\nbristles that are of another colour than \\nwhite, and all of them quite smooth, sur- \\nround the top of the seed, fig, 1 89. \\n/.Fringed, (ciliatus), when stiff, close-pressed \\nsetae, are set with very short, and hardly \\nvisible hairs. This kind connects the for- \\nmer with the following species. \\n\\nTEttMINOLOGY. \\n145 \\nm. Plumose, (plumosusj when the pappus is \\ncomposed of fine hairs or setae, that are \\nthemselves set with line liairs on the sides, \\nfig. 185. \\n■n. Uniform, ( uniformis ), when all the pappi in \\na common perianth are of the same form. \\no. Unlike, (dlfformis s. dissimilisj, when in a \\ncommon perianth the pappi are of different \\nforriis. \\np. Doubled, (gemmatus)y when a pappus is \\ncomposed of two kinds ; for instance, when \\nthe pappus on the outside is calyciforn], on \\nthe inside capillary or hairy ; or on the \\noutside calyciform, on the inside setaceous ; \\nor also on the outside calyciform, and on \\nthe inside plumose. \\nN. We must beware of confounding the hairs, \\nwhich sometimes cover seeds, with the true pappus. \\nIn Eriophorum there is no true pappus, but merely \\nhairs that surround the seeds : this is called LaJia \\npappi/ormis. \\n3. The TUFT, (desma s. coma), is a body that ap- \\npears like a pilose pappus, and is not to be distin- \\nguished from it except by its origin. The coma is \\nalways attached to the seeds that are contained in a \\npericarp, and never occupies the place of a calyx, as \\nin Asclepias syriaca^ Epilobium, &c. fig. 168, I69. \\n4. The TAIL, ( Cauda), is a long, thread-hke body, \\nthat appears on the top of the seed, or of the utricu- \\nlus, and is set with fine hairs, as in the pasque-flower, \\nAnemone Pulsatilla, Clematis, and many others, \\nfig. 164. \\n7C \\n\\n145 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nN. The seeds of the Typha latifoUa seem to have \\na pappus ; but it is at the top a smooth, straight \\nCauda, and the seed is supported on a long stalk, \\nthat is set with hairs on the under pan, like a \\npappus. \\n5. The ROSTRUM is a persistent style remaining on \\nthe seed, or on the pericarp, as in Scandix, Sinapis» \\n&c. When the rostrum is crooked, it is called a \\nhorn, (cornu), as in the capsule of Nigella damasce- \\n7ia, and many others. \\n6. The WING, (alaj, is a cartilaginous, thin, trans- \\nparent membrane, that is found on the top, on the \\nback, or on the margin of the seed or of the peri- \\ncarp. Of this there are the following varieties : \\na. Monopterygia, wiien there is but one wing. \\nb. Dipterygia, s. bialata, when there are two \\nwings, fig. l6l. \\nc. Tripteri/gia, s. trialata, three wings. \\nd. Tetraptcra s. quadrialata^ four wings. \\ne. Pentaptcra et polyptera s. quinquealata et \\nmidtialata, with five or many wings. This \\nkind is found in many capsules, and in the \\nseeds of some umbelliferous plants. The \\nseeds likewise of umbelliferous plants that \\nhave many wings are called scndiia molai- \\ndinacca. \\nN. To this term is also to be referred the mem- \\nbranaceous transparent margin, (margo viemhrana- \\ncetisj, which surrounds some pericarps and seeds. \\n7. The CHEST, (crista), is a thick, coriaceous or \\neork-like wing, indented or deeply split, that appears \\n\\nTERMINOLO(;V. 147 \\now the top of some pericarps, as in Hedysarum Cm- \\ntu gain. \\n8. The uiBS, (costa s.jugumj^ are very prominent \\nridges, that are seen in some pericai ps, and on the \\nseeds of umbeHiferous plants. \\ny. The WAKT, ( verruca), is a small, obtuse, round \\neminence, found on many seeds. \\n10. HoARiN£Ss, fpruinaj, is a fine while powder, \\nthat often covers tiie seeds and the pericarp, as in tiie \\nplumb, Prunus dumcstica. Sec \\n11. The SPRINGER, (elater), is a filiform elastic \\nbody found on the seeds of the Musci hepatici; as, \\nMaixhantia,Jungermannia,, and which throws them \\nto a distance. It has in general, when observed \\nwith a magnifier, the appearance of a small chain, \\n■whence it has sometimes been called also Catcnula. \\n12. The HAIR-NET, (capUlitium). This is a re- \\nticulated collection of hairs that serve to fasten the \\nseeds of some species of Fungi, such as Trichia, \\nStemonites, &c. fig. 301. \\n13. The G Ro u N D- B R I ST L E, ( trickidium s. pecten ), \\nis a very tender, simple, and sometimes branched \\nhair, which supports the seed in some Fungi, as Ly- \\ncoperdon, Geastrum*. \\n§ 118. \\nThe BASE, (basis), is the part on which the whole \\nflower stands, and the fruit too, when the flower has \\n* With rt\\'gard to the surfaces and thecoTcring that are pro- \\nper to the pericarp and to the seeds, the terms mentioned ia \\n§ <5. yf\\'iW serve.

There are two kinds of base ; viz. the Re- \\nceptacle, (rcceptaculum), and the Fruit-bed, (thula- \\nmus). \\nThe Receptacle is a body, more or less extended, \\non the surface of which the flowers and afterwards \\nthe fruit stand; it is of two kinds, namely> the \\nsimple, ( propruwi J, which bears but one flower ; \\nand the common, ( commune) j which bears several \\nflowers. \\n5 119. \\nThe simple Receptacle, ( receptaculum proprium J, \\nis not much raised : it has ommonly no greater sur- \\nface than is necessary for the space occupied by the \\nflower-stalk. Several plants, however, are an excep- \\ntion to this, particularly those that have many styles. \\nIn these it cannot be otherwise ; a number of styles \\noccupies a considerable space ; and therefore the re- \\nceptacle is sometimes flat, ( planum ), sometimes arch- \\ned, (co7ivei\\'uinJ, and sometimes spherical, (giobo- \\nsum). But the most remarkable kinds are tht dry, \\n(sicciim ), that is of a hard substance, and the fleshy, \\n(carnosum), that is soft and succulent, as in the \\nstrawberr}\\', Fragaria msca^ fig 2 J 3. \\' This fruit is \\nnot a proper berry, but is a fleshy receptacle with \\nfree seeds. In a few plants that have but one style, \\nthe receptacle is uncommonly strong and fleshy, as \\nin the cashew-nut, Anacardium occidentale, fig. 214. \\nThe fruit of this plant is a nut, that stands on a \\npear-shaped fleshy receptacle, as is the case likewise \\nwith ihe.\\'^m\\'vxxY^xis Anacardium, fig. 216. and Gom- \\nY^h\\\\ajapotapita^ fig. 215. But the most remarkable \\n\\nTERMINOLOGY. \\n149 \\ni$ a Japanese tree that bears small capsules, and the \\nflower-stalk of which is so extremely thick and fleshy, \\nthat it has the appearance of a fleshy receptacle : it \\nis the Hovenia dulcis, fig. 208. \\nAnother kind of receptacle still is seen in unilocu- \\nlar capsules : it is found in the centre of these, is py- \\nramidal, and of a coriaceous substance : this is call- \\ned a spongy receptacle, ( rcceptaculum spofigiosum ). \\n§ 120. \\nThe common Receptacle, ( receptacidum cmnmune J, \\nis of wide circumference, and contains a multitude of \\nflowers. It is of the following!; kinds : \\n1. Flat, (plamiyn), that is perfectly even, fig. 218. \\n2. Convex, ( convcxum J, that is somewhat elevated \\nin the centre. \\n3. Conical, conicum)^ that rises in the centre into \\na high round point, fig. 221. \\n4. Clubbed, ( ckrccttum ), that is much prolonged \\nand resembles a club, as in Arum, fig. 42. \\n5. Closed, (clausum), having the form of a ball or \\npear, internally hollow, and the flowers seated on the \\ninner surface, as in Ficus, fig. 21.9, 220. \\n6. Quadrifid, (quadrijidum), which is closed at \\nfirst and formed like the last ; but when the flowers, \\nwhich stand on the inner surface, are perfectly form- \\ned, it bursts at the apex with four valves, as in Mithri- \\ndatea quadrijida. \\n7. Flat, (jjlcicentiforme), when a plane, broad re- \\nceptacle is without a calyx, as in Dorstenia, fig. 123. \\n8. Smooth, (glabricm), that is destitute of hairs \\nor points, \\nK 3 \\n\\n150 PRINCIPLES or BOTANY, ETC. \\n9. Hairy, (pilosum), that is set with stiff short \\nhairs. \\n10. Villous, (villosum), that is set with long, soft \\nhairs. \\n1 1 . Setaceous, ( setuceus J, that is covered with stiff, \\nbristle-like hairs. \\n12. Prickly, (spicniatumj, when it is covered with \\nfleshy, erect, short points. \\n13. Warty, ( tuberculatum )y when it is covered \\nwith small round eminences. \\n14. Punctured, (punctatum), when the surface is \\nGoveied with small, deep holes, fig. 218. \\n15. ^Qvoh\\\\Qu\\\\-dXe, (scrohiculatum)j when there are \\ndeep round pits on the surface, 221. \\n16\\'. Honey-combed, (fcrcosum), when large deep \\nholes, like the cells in honey-combs, cover the sur- \\nface. \\n17. Various, (I\\'arhnn), when the common recep- \\ntacle is smooth on the margin and hairy in the \\ncentre ; or when the centre is smooth, the rini \\nchaffy, hairy or prickly. \\n18. Chaffy, (palcaceum), that is set with oblong, \\nobtuse, short, hai:d leaves ; these leaves are called \\nchaff, (palcoej. \\n§ 121 \\nThe FRUIT-BED, (tlialamus), is a body more or \\nless extended, enclosing in its substance the fruit, \\nwhich cannot be seen till the former is separated \\nfrom it. r>ut if this is divided by thin vertical sec- \\ntions, the seed-cases may, by the help of a micro- \\nscope, be seen in it These seed- cases open on Ui« \\n\\nTERMINOLOGV. 151 \\nupper surface of the Fruit-bed, and the seed is \\nthrown out of very narrow openings in a manner \\nvisible to the naked eye. The following kinds of \\nthalamus have been distinguished, viz. \\n1. The target, fpelta), is a thin, round or oblong \\nfruit- bed, which is chiefly found in the genus Pelti- \\ndea, fig. 226. It is found commonly at the rim of \\nthe frond in these plants, and is covered by a tender \\nskin, which becomes loose. \\n2. The shield, f scutella is a plate-shaped fruit- \\nbed, sometimes flat, sometimes convex, or even \\nconcave, furnished with a margin variously formed, \\nwhich is proper only to the Algae, fig. 3. \\n3. The tubercle, (tuherculum), is a convex fruit- \\nbed, which has no raised margin, but which bends \\nitself outwards ; otherwise it is either round, or long, \\nor irregularly formed. It is also to be seen in the \\nAlgae. \\n4. The Trica s. Gyroma ; this has the appearance \\nof a saucer, differing only in having concentric or ir- \\nregularly raised lines running into one another on its \\nsurface. It is peculiar to the genus Umbilicaria. \\n5. The Lirella, is a linear shaped fruit-bed with a \\nfurrow in the middle. It is found in the genus Ope- \\ngrapha. \\n6. The Cistella is shaped like a ball; its outer \\nskin separates, and within it is filled with a powdery \\nsubstance. When this is dispersed it appears hollow. \\nIt is found in some Algae, as Sphaerophorus. \\n7. The Orbiculus is a round fruil-bed, flat on both \\nsides, in the substance of some fimgi, as Nidularia. \\n\\n11. OF CLASSIFICATION. \\n§ 124. \\nThe human mind is unable to take in the various \\nforms of the vegetable kingdom at one view : it must \\ntherefore have recourse to some contrivance in order \\nto facilitate the acquisition of knowledge, and to sa- \\ntisfy its curiosity. It attains its object in the most \\nperfect manner when it reduces its knowledge to a \\nr>3\\'Stcm. \\nA botanical system is a list of all the plants hitbei- \\nto discovered, arranged according to certain charac- \\nters, and their deviations from them. When a per- \\nson has once ^customed himself to sonie system, his \\nprogress will be doubled, and he will form a much \\nbetter judgment of plants than he was able to do be- \\nfore. \\n§ 123. \\nThere have been men of high abilities who have \\nmaintained, that all nature might be reduced to sys- \\ntem ; there have, on the contrary, been oilier «reat \\n\\nCLASSIFICATION\". \\n153 \\nmen who Imve denied the truth of this position, and \\nhave rejected all systematic arranijement, or even \\nthe least trace of it. Others again, and indeed the \\ngreatest number, believe that there is no real system \\nof nature, but that there is a chain of beings. \\nNature connects the most multifarious bodies by \\ntheir form, size, colours, and qualities. Each indi- \\nvidual body, each plant has some affinity with several \\nothers, and this goes on to infinity. But who is able \\nto declare the order followed by nature ? All affini- \\nties and natural arrangements are but apparent traces \\nof a natural system. By a more accurate investiga- \\ntion, we find those boasted affinities not so great, \\nand the natural arrangements not so luminous. We \\nendeavour, by our systematic divisions, to arrange \\nbodies in straight lines ; but nature forms in the \\nwhole an intricate and infinite ramification, which \\n■we are too short-sighted to perceive, and too super- \\nficial to fathom. Perhaps in some centuries hence, \\nwhen every corner of the globe has been examined, \\nand multiplied experience has distinguished what is \\ntrue from what is false, we may be able to judge \\nmore soundly of the order of nature. \\n§ 124. \\nBut tiK)U2h a true natural system has not been \\ndiscovered, it cannot be denied that some plants are. \\nallied by such very striking reijemblHrices,\\' that they \\ntnay be considered as belonging to natural classes. \\nThose resemblances, however, extend but to few \\nplants, and there are many wanting to connect one \\nnatural family with another. These affinities, how- \\n\\n154 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\never, have been sufficient to enable botanists to ar- \\nrange plants by their external characters, and this \\narrangement has been called a Natural System, \\n(Syslana naturak.) \\nOther botanists have founded their systems on the \\nnumber, proportion and agreement of minute and not \\nvery obvious parts, and such a system has been call- \\ned Artificial, (Systema cu^tijiciale. ) \\nOthers again select the sexual parts as the distinc- \\ntive characters, and found their system on the num- \\nber and variety of these parts. This is called the \\nSexual System, (Systema scxuale.) \\n§ 125. \\nSome of those natural families of plants, which \\nthe beginner ought to be well acquainted with, are \\nthe following : \\n1. The FUNGI : these are distintruished from \\nother plants by their peculiar form, which is com- \\nmonly fleshy, coiiaceous, or woody, fig. 4, 6, 7, 223, \\n§24, 225. \\n2. The ALGAE come somewhat nearer in their ap- \\npearance to other plants ; but neither stem nor \\nleaves are to be found in them. Their form is very \\nvarious; sometimes they have the appearance of \\nflour or fibres; or they resemble the fret-work in \\narchitecture, fig. 3, 226. \\n3. The Muscr, Mosses. In these the external \\nappearance is almost the same with that of other \\nplants, but their fruit and leaves are difierent. \\nThey are divided into, \\na. Miisci frondosi : these have a capsule which \\n\\nCLASSIFICATION. \\n1.^5 \\nis furnished witii a lid, and the leaves are \\nsmall, fig. 138. \\nb The Musci hepatici: these in general have no \\nstem ; their leaves grow larger, and lie flat. \\nThe capsule bursts into several valves, fig. 127« \\n4. The FiLiCEs, Ferns, are plants that never \\npush from the root more than one leaf on a foot- \\nstalk, (some Indian species excepted), and the leaf \\nat its evolution is generally rolled up in a spiral. \\nTheir fructification is either in a spike, (spiciftrae)y \\nfig. 9j or on the back of the leaf, (epiphylbspermaQ \\ns. dorsiflorae)^ fig. 15. ; or lastly, on the root in the \\nform of a knob, ( rhizospermae), \\n5. The GRAMiNA, Grasses. These have their \\nleaves long and slender, their stem, which is called \\nstraw, is commonly jointed, and each flower bears \\nbut one seed : the flower likewise is very different \\nfrom that of other plants, fig. 34. \\n6. The LI LI A, Lilies, have bulbous or tuberous \\nroots, long, slender leaves, specious flowers, without \\ncalyx, or instead of it a spatha. \\n7. \\'J\\'he PALMAE, Palms ; these have an arboreous \\nstem, but never branches ; the leaves rise -^from the \\nStem, which is called stipes. The flowers issue from \\na spatha. \\n8. Plantae, Plants, are all that do not come under \\nthe above divisions ; they are either Herbs, Under- \\nshrubs, Shrubs, or Trees. \\na. Herbae, are all such plants as bear flowers \\nand seeds but once, and then die. They \\ndo this either in one year, and are then \\ncalled Annuals, (plantae annuae ;) or they \\n\\n155 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nbear in the first year leaves, in the second \\nflowers and seeds, and then die : these are \\ncalled biennials, (plantae bicnnes.) \\nb. \\\\]nAGV\\'h\\\\\\\\mhs,(suffriitices): in these the stem \\nperishes annually, but the root remains. \\nc. Shrubs, (fniiices) ; of these the stem con- \\ntinues many years, and is divided below into \\nbranches. \\nd. Trees, far bores): of these the stem endures \\nfor many years, and is divided at top into \\nbranches. \\nClimate and culture have great influence on these \\ndivisions ; so that often ti\\'ees and shrubs insensibly \\nrun into one another. \\n§ 12a \\nBefore we proceed to treat of the diflerent sys- \\ntems, it is necessary to explain what is meant by \\nClass, Order, Genus, Species and Variety. \\nA System is first divided into classes and orders. \\nIn each system a certain part of plants, such as the \\nflower, the fruit, &c. is assumed as the foundation, \\nand upon that, classes, orders, and genera are con- \\nstructed. When a particular investigated character \\nis common to many plants, these plants make a \\nClass, (dassis). Should some of the plants, be- \\nside the particular character of the class, agree in \\nanother character, these form an Order, (ordoj. \\nAnd if a few of the plants, which already agree \\nHI two of the chai-acters, are found to possess others \\nin conmion, these are called a Gems. Each of the \\npiants in this last division is. called a Specie.^, It is \\n\\nCLASSIFICATION, \\n157 \\nnecessary in a species that it remain always tlie same \\nfrom seed. A Variety, (mnetas,) is a species that \\ndiffers only in colour, size, or in some accidental \\ncircumstance. From the seed the variety changes \\nat last into the true species. Of this more in \\n§ 185. \\n§ 127. \\nFrom a good system we expect that the part se- \\nlected, according to which the classes, orders and \\ngenera are framed, shall be easily seen, and without \\ndifficulty found ; and that it shall be common to all \\nplants, and not subject to variation. Besides, no \\nsystem ought to be divided according to any other \\ncharacter than that first selected. No good system \\nshould have too many subdivisions, and, if possible, \\nshould only consist of classes and orders. The \\norders should likewise be founded only on one \\npart. \\n§ 128. \\nFor a beginner it is very convenient to be ac- \\nquainted with several systems, especially if at the \\nsame time he know^s the defects of each, that he \\nmay be able, by his own experience, to have re- \\ncourse to that which particularly suits him. I shall \\nhere give a view of the principal systems, in the \\nlanguage in which they were originally written ; and \\nshould any term occur which is not to be found \\nin the preceding Terminology, I shall briefly ex- \\nplain it. \\n6 \\n\\n158 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\n§ 129. \\nCaesalpinus was the first botanist who invented \\na system. He selected the fruit, and the situation \\nof the corculum, as the distinguishing characters. \\nHis system has fifteen classes, viz. \\n1. Arbores, corculo ex apice seminis. \\n. a basi seminis. \\n3. Herbae, soHtariis seminibus. \\n4. baccis. \\n5. capsulis. \\n6. binis seminibus. \\n7. capsuHs, \\n8. ■ triplici principio, fibrosac. \\ng. bulbosae. \\n10. quaternis seminibus. \\n11. pluribus seminibus. Anthemides. \\n12. Cichoraceae <r. \\nAcanaceae. \\n] S. flore communi. \\n14. folhcuhs. \\n15. flore fructuque carentes. \\nThis system is, for our times, when such a multi- \\ntude of plants have been discovered, no longer of use. \\nConsidered as the first attempt at system it is en- \\ntitled to great consideration. The fruit is a very \\nconstant part, and this classification would be par- \\nticularly commendable, if plants and trees had not \\nbeen separated. In the two first classes trees are \\ndistinguished according to the situation of the cor- \\nculum ; the other classes are arranged according to \\nthe fruit of the plants. The eighth and ninth classes \\n\\nCLASSIFICATION \\n159 \\nhave a trilocular capsule, and are distinguished ac- \\ncording to the situation of the corculum ; the other \\nclasses are arranged according to the fruit of the \\nplants. The eighth and ninth classes have a trilo- \\ncular capsule, and are distinguished according as \\nthe root is either fibrous or bulbous. The eleventh, \\ntwelfth, and thirteenth classes contain the compound \\nflowers, {§ 72, No. 3) ; the twelfth, semilloscular \\nflowers, {§ 72, No. 1) ; the thirteenth, discoid \\nflowers, {§ 72, No. 2). The fourteenth class con- \\ntains such plants as bear se\\'seral capsules together, \\nas the ranunculus, anemone, &c. The last class in- \\ncludes jVIosses, Algae, Fungi and Filices. The an- \\ncients believed that these^ plants carried neither \\nflowers nor seeds. \\n§ 130. \\nMori SON constructed his system according to the \\nflower, and the external appearance of the plant. \\nHe has eighteen classes : \\n1. Lignosae, Arbores. : \\n2. Frutices. \\n5. Sufl\\'rutices. \\n4. Ilerbaceae, Scandentes. \\n5. Leguminosae. \\n6. — — Siliquosae. \\n7. . Tricapsulares. \\n8. ■ a numero capsularum dictac. \\ncj. . Corymbiferae. \\n10. Lactescentes. s. papposae. \\n11. Culmiferae 5. Calinariae. \\n12. Umbellifcrae. \\n\\n16\\'0 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\n13. Herbaceae, Tricoccae. \\n14. Galeatae. \\n15. Multicapsulares. \\n16. Bacciferae. \\n17. — Capillares. \\n18. Heteroclitae. \\nThe defect of this system, as of all the old sy«- \\ntems, consists in the various foundations of the di- \\nvision, and in separating trees and plants. By Suf- \\nfrutices, Morison means small shrubs, but not ac- \\ncording to our definition, {§ 125). Even some mo- \\nderns use the term Suffriite.v for a small shrub. I\\'he \\nfourth class contains all twining plants, as the Cu- \\ncurbita, Convolvulus, &c. The seventh class in- \\ncludes plants which have a trilocular capsule. In \\nthe eighth class are plants that have sometimes more, \\nsometimes fewer cells in the capsules. The ninth \\nclass contains the compound llowers that have no \\npappus, or at least only a membranaceous one. In \\nthe tenth class are all the compound flowers that \\nhave a plumose, pilose, setaceous, &c. pappus. To \\nthe eleventh class belong all the grasses and plants \\nallied to them ; to the twelfth, the umbelliferous \\nplants ; to the thirteenth, those which have a trilo- \\ncular capsule, (J 104, No. 5). The fourteenth \\nclass contains the ringent or labiated flowers ; the \\nseventeenth contains only the Filiccs ; and the \\ncightrenth includes the Mosses, Algae, Fungi and \\nCorals. It is to be regretted that Mom son often \\narranges plants in a class to which they do not \\nbelong. \\n\\nCLASSIFICATION. \\n161 \\n} 131. \\nHermann made use of the fruit, of the flower, \\nand also, but on few occasions, of the external ap- \\npearance, in framing his system. \\nHerbae gymnospermae. \\n1. \\nMonospermae. \\nSimplices. \\n% \\nCompositae. \\n3. \\nDispermae. \\nStellatae. \\n4. \\nUmbellatae. \\n5. \\nTetraspermae. \\nAsperifoliae. \\n6. \\nVerticillatae. \\n7. \\nPolyspermae. \\nGymnopolyspermae. \\nHerbae Angiospermae\\' \\n8.

But to make it useful in the pre- \\nsent times, it would need great amendment. The \\nabove enumeration of the classes renders any fur- \\nther explanation unnecessary. \\nI 132. \\nChristopher Knaut has also chosen the fruit \\nas the foundation of his system, but -vvith this dif- \\nference, that he has taken into account the number \\nof the petals and the regularity of the flower. His \\nsystem has a great resemblance to tiie first of Ray. \\n{ 133. \\nBoERiiAAVE has constructed his system partly \\nfrom that of Hermann, Tournefort and Ray. He \\ntoo has separated trees and plants. The number \\nof the capsules, of the petals, and of the cotyledons \\nis made use of. \\nJ 134. \\nRay conjoins fruit, flower, and external appear- \\nance, like his predecessors.

In the first class stand all the \\nFuci, Zoophytes, and Corals. In the fifth all plants \\nthat have no petals ; in the sixth the semifloscular \\nflovi^ers, 72, No. ].); in the seventh the discoid \\nand radiate flowers that have pilose pappus; in the \\neighth class are those same flowers, but which have \\nno pappus ; and in the ninth class stand all those \\ncapitated compound flowers which have a membra- \\nneous pappus. The twelftli class contains plants \\nwith verticillated flowers, that at the same time have \\na corolla of four petals and two naked seeds. Un- \\nder the thirteenth class are arranged all the rough- \\nleaved plants, that bear a monopetalous tubular co- \\nrolla, and four naked seeds. To the fourteenth be- \\nlong the labiated or ringent flowers. In the twenty- \\nfourth class stand all the Lilies. To the twenty- \\nfifth belong, all the Grasses, and to the twenty sixth \\nthose which cannot be reduced under any of the \\nforegoing. \\n§ 135. \\nCamellus has attempted a very singular system, \\nframed from the valves of the capsule and tiieir num- \\nber.

The orders are taken from \\nthe fruit according as it is naked, { fructiis nudus), or \\ncontained in a pericarp; and this last is dis inguish- \\ned according as it is dry ( pericmyium siccumj, or \\n(pericarpium carnosum). \\n{ 137. \\nChristian Knaut has adopted Rivinus\\'s method \\nalmost unchanged, but in some degree reversed. The \\nclasses he forms from the number of the petals, and \\nhis subdivisions he takes from their regularity or ir- \\nregularity. But he denied that there w-ere any \\nflowers without a corolla, or that there was such a \\nthing as naked seeds. \\nJ 138. \\nThe System of Tournefort was for a considerable \\ntime the favourite system of all botanists, and it de- \\nserves particular attention. \\nHerbae et suffrutices. \\n1.

But \\nthe ficfure of the corolla is so various that it is often \\nwith difficulty described. Besides, some species of \\ncorolla so much resemble others that they are not \\neasily distinguished. It is on this account chiefly \\nthat Tournefort\\'s system is not used in these days. \\nThe orders in his method are taken from the style \\nand from the fruit. When the germen is under the \\n\\n16S \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC: \\nflower, he says \" calyj;\\' abiit in fructum when it is \\nincluded in the flower he says pistillum abiit iit \\n\" fructum.\\'\" The fruit is also more accurately dis- \\ntinguished, as it is a capsule, berry, &c. \\nJ 139. \\n\"We shall here pass by several of the less im- \\nportant systems that are merely alterations of the \\nforegoing. These alterations consist sometimes of a \\nsingle circumstance, of which the former authors \\nhad taken no notice. Of this Pontedeka may \\nserve as an instance. He took Tournefort\\'s sys- \\ntem, and combining it with that of Kivinus, only \\nseparated the plants that bear buds from those that \\nhave none. Another more worthy of consideration \\nis that of Magnolius ; though it too is of little \\nuse in practice. He forms his classes intirely on the \\ncalyx. Many similar systems may be found in \\nAdanson, an emment naturalist, who has exhibit- \\ned upwards of sixty systems, and has shewn evident- \\nly that many more might be formed, if science was \\nto derive any benefit from the labour. \\n^ 140. \\nThe systems we have detailed are either built on \\nthe fruit or the flower, and their parts : but none \\nbefore Gleditsch had attempted one on the situa- \\ntion of the stamina. His classes are the following : \\n1. Thalamostcmonis. \\n% Petalostemonis. \\n3. Calycostemonis. \\n\\nCLASSIFICATION. \\n169 \\n4. Stylostemonis. \\n5. Cryptostemonis. \\nThe insertion of the stamina here forms the classes : \\nin the first class they stand on the receptacle ; in the \\nsecond on the corolla ; in the third on the calyx ; in \\nthe fourth on the style ; and to the fifth class belong \\nplants whose flowers are inconspicuous, as the Fili- \\nces, Musci, Algae and Fungi. The orders are form- \\ned according to the number of the antherae ; that is, \\nwhether they are one or more in a single flower, viz. \\nMonantherae, Diantherae, &c. But as thei;e are so \\nfew classes, it is obvious that the orders must have \\nmany subdivisions ; and this is the only objection to \\nthis, otherwise, very elegant system, which stands in \\nthe way of its further usefulness. \\nThe same system has been lately somewhat changed \\nby Monch. His class s are, \\n1. Thalamostemon. \\n2. Petalostemon. \\n3. Parapetalostemon, i. e. when the stamina \\nstand upon leaves similar to petals, which \\nare found in the corolla. \\n4. Calycostemon. \\n5. Allagostenion, when the stamina stand alter- \\nnately on the calyx and petals. \\nG. Stylostemon, when they stand on the style. \\n7- Stigmatostemon, when they are inserted in \\nthe stigma. \\n8. Cryptostemon. \\nThe orders he has taken from the difTerences in \\nthe fruit ; but as some classes were too large, he was \\n\\n170 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTAKY, ETC. \\nobliged to take his subdivisions from other parts of \\nthe flower. \\n§ 141. \\nHaller endeavoured, very ingeniously, to frame \\na natural system on the cotyledons, the calyx, the \\ncorolla, the stamina, and the sexes of plants. His \\nclasses, of which he afterwards found it necessary to \\nmake some little alteration, are the following : \\n1. Fungi. \\n2. Musci. \\n3: Epiphyllospermae. \\n4. A petal ae. \\n5. Gramina. \\n6. Graminibus affinia. \\n7- Monocotyledones Pctaloideae. \\n8. Polystemones. \\n9» Diplostemones. \\n10. Isostemones. \\n11. Mejostemones. \\n12. Staminibus sesquialteris. \\n13. sesquitertiis. \\n14. quatuor. Ringentcs. \\n15. Congregatae. \\nTo the third class belong all the Filices . To the \\nseventh all the Lilies : In the eicjhth class stand all \\nthose plants whose filaments exceed in number the \\nsegments or petals of the corolla three or four times. \\nTo the ninth class belong all those plants which have \\ntwice as many filaments as there are segments or \\npetals in the corolla. To the tenth belong those \\nthat have the same number of filaments as there are \\nsegments or petals in the corolla. In the eleventh \\n\\nCLASSIFICATION. \\n171 \\nclass are included all those plants whose filaments \\nare fewer in number than the segments or petals of \\nthe corolla. To the twelfth belong ail the cruci- \\nform plants; to the thirteenth, all the papiliona- \\nceous; and to the fourteenth, the ringent or la- \\nbiated flowers with four stamina. The last class \\ncontains all the compound flowers. The orders in \\nthis system are taken from all parts of the flower \\nand of the fruit. \\nRoYEN and Wachexdorf have constructed si- \\nmilar systems, the first of which deserves the pre- \\nference. But all these systems are attended with \\ndifficulty, on account of the various parts of plants \\nw hich we must have constantly in view, and the \\ngreat number of subdivisions which they neces- \\nsarily require. \\n§ 142. \\nLiNNTAEUs, in his System, has fixed upon the sta- \\nojina as the foundation of his divisions. \\n1. Monandria, 13. Polyandria, \\n2. Diandria, 14. Didynamia, \\n3. Triandria, 15. Tetradynamia, \\n4. letrandria, }6. Monadelphia, \\n5. Pentandria, 17. Diadelphia, \\n6. Ilexandria, 18. Polyadelphia, \\n7. Ileptandria, 19- Syngenesia, \\n8. Octandria, 20, Gynandria, \\ng. Enneandria, 21. Monoecia, \\n10. Decandria, 22. Dioecia, \\n11. Dodecandria, 23. Polygamia, \\n12. IcQsandria, 24. Cryptogamia, \\n6 \\n\\n172 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANV, ETC. \\nFrom the first to the tenth class the stamina are \\nnumbered, fig. 95, 79, 115, 81, 153. 154, 110, \\n] 26. To the eleventh class belong all the plants \\nthat have from ten to nineteen stamina. To the \\ntwelfth class those plants which have many stami- \\nna inserted in the calyx, fig. .52, 53. The thir- \\nteenth class contains plants that have a great num- \\nber of stamina from twenty to one thousand in \\none flower, fig. 11 6\\\\ The fourteenth consists of \\nplants that have four stamina in one flower, of which \\ntwo are longer than the rest, fig. 50, 51. In the \\nfifteenth class stand those which have six stamina, \\nof which two are shorter than the rest, fig. 145, \\n149. The sixteenth class contains plants whose \\nfilaments are connected and form a cylinder, fig. \\n56, 57. In the seventeenth class stand those plants \\nwhose filaments are united in two parcels, fig. 108, \\n109. To the eighteenth class belong those plants \\nwhose filaments are united in several parcels, fig. \\n150. In the nineteenth class stand those plants \\n■whose antherae are united in a cylinder. The \\ntwentieth class consists of those plants whose sta- \\nmina stand upon the style ; the tw enty-first consists \\nof flowers of different sexes, namely, male and fe- \\nmale on one plant ; the twenty- second, of male and \\nfemale flowers, but so divided that one plant bears \\nonly male flowers, the other only female ; the twen- \\nty-third has flowers of both sexes and hermaphrodite \\nflowers together, so that the plant contains either \\nmale and hermaphrodite flowers or female and her- \\nmaphrodite flowers. To the last class belong all \\n\\nCLASSIFICATION. \\n17S \\nplants whose flowers are not visible to the naked \\neye, these are the Fihces, Musci, Algae and Fungi. \\n§ 143. \\nThe Orders in most of the classes^are taken from \\nthe style, in some from the fruit, and in the last classes \\nfrom the filaments. From the first to the thirteenth \\nclass the oi\\'ders are taken from the style, viz. ?nono- \\ngynia when there is only one style in the flower, \\n%. I J 4, 115, 144, 153, &c. two, three, \\nfour, &c. styled, (di^ triy tetra, ^c. polygynia J, ac- \\ncording to their number, fig. 135. In general we \\ncount to six, and then say polygy?iia. If there \\nshould be several germens and but one style, the \\nstyle only is numbered. The orders are never taken \\nfrom the germens except when the style is wanting. \\nThe Orders of the fourteenth class are taken from \\nthe fruit ; there are two, viz. Gymnospermia when the \\nseeds are naked, and Aiigiospermia when they are \\ncontained in a pericarp. Those of the fifteenth \\nclass are, like the foregoing, taken from the fruit, \\nwith this diflerence, that here there are no naked \\ngeeds but a Siliqua, and the Orders are named ac- \\ncording to the size of this, siliculosa and siltquosa. \\nIn the sixteenth, seventeeth, eighteenth, twentieth, \\ntwenty-first and twenty-second classes, the Orders \\nare denominated according to the number of the \\nstamina; in the l6th, 17th, 18th and 20th, they \\nare numbered from Diandria upv/ards ; in the 21st \\nand 22d from Monandria. \\nThe lyth Class contains none but compound \\nflowers, except a very few\". Linnaeus consider* \\n\\n174 \\nPRINCiriES OF BOTANY, ETC \\nthese flowers as a Polygamy, (polygamia), and pre- \\nfixes this word to the name of each Order in which \\nthe compound flowers are contained ; for example, \\nPolygamia aequalis, when all the florets which a \\ncompound flower contains are hermaphrodites, and \\nsimilar in form, whether they be ligulate or tubular, \\nfig. 85, 143. \\nPolygamia superjlua, \\'when the compound flower \\nis radiate, the disk bearing hermaphrodite florets, and \\nthe ray, fertile florets. \\nPolygamia frustrat^ea, when the compound flower \\nis radiate, the disk consisting of fertile, hermaphro- \\ndite florets, and the ray of barren female florets. \\nPolygamia necessaiia, when the compound flower \\nis radiate, the disk consisting of barren hermaphro- \\ndite florets, the ray of fertile female florets. \\nPolygamia segrcgata, when in a compound flower \\nbesides the common perianth, each floret is furnished \\nwith its own particular calyx. \\nMonogamia is an Order containing all the plants \\nwhich according to strict system belong to this class, \\nthough they are not compound flowers. \\nThe plants of the 21st and 22d classes, as we \\nhave said already, are divided into Orders accord- \\ning to the number of the stamina ; but besides these, \\nhere are two orders taken from the connection of \\nthe filaments and antherae, namely, Monadelphia and \\nSyngenesia, The last Order of both classes is called \\nGynandria ; not because in the plants which belong \\nto it, the stamina stand upon the style ; but because \\nin the male flowers there is a production resembling \\na style to which the stamina are attached. This \\n\\nCLASSIFICATION. \\n17 S \\nproduction Linnaeus considers as an imperfect pis- \\ntillum. \\nIn the 23d class the Orders are called Monoecia, \\nDioecia and Tr \\'weda. The last class has the fol- \\nlowing Orders, Filices, Musci, Algae and Fmgi, \\n{§ 125). \\n§ 144. \\nFrom the aforegoing analysis it will be seen that \\nthe Linnaean system consists of an artificial and \\nsexual arrangement, and that it does not answer the \\nidea, we have given above, 127), of a perfect \\nsystem. But till such a one is found out, a system \\npartly natural, partly artificial is the best ; we must, \\nhowever, as we cannot deny the usefulness of Lin- \\nnaeus\\'s system, point out its defects. \\nLinnaeus endeavoured, from the number of the \\nstamina, their various lengths, and different modes \\nof connection, to unite a natural classification with \\nan artificial one. Hence arose some faults, which \\nwould not have happened had he, at the same time, \\nmade use of the corolla as a character. For in- \\nstance, in the fourteenth class are contained the la- \\nbiated and ringent flowers; but because Linnaeus \\ncharacterised it from the four stamina, two of which \\nare shorter ; there are some of these plants which \\nmust stand in the second class, and others in the \\nfourth, though they properly belong to this class. \\nIn the same manner, all the papilionaceous flowers \\nare referred to the seventeenth class; but the as- \\nsumed character, viz. that the filaments are united \\ninto two sets, is not to be found in all these plants : \\n\\n176 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nMany have the filaments united in one cylinder ; and \\nin the tenth class stand many plants with papiliona- \\nceous flowers. These two faults arc not the greatest \\n■which may be attributed to this system : it is a more \\nimportant objection that Linnaeus has numbered the \\nstamina in the first classes without attending to their \\ninsertion, while in the twelfth he remarks \\'that they \\nare inserted in the calyx, and in the twentieth, that \\nthey stand on the pistillum. In the nineteenth class \\nare comprehended all the compound flowers, and \\nyet he drags into the last order of this class other \\nplants whose antherae are only sometimes united. \\nIt is also to be regretted, that in the 21st, 22d and \\n23d classes Linnaeus has tnken notice of dilferent \\nsexes in the same plant, which he had not done be- \\nfore ; there being many plants in the former classes \\nthat properly belong to these. \\n§ 145. \\nThese defects and some others, from which no \\nsystem can easily be exempted, have suggested to \\nseveral botanists the possibility of correcting them \\nand making the system more useful. Among all \\nthe improvements of the Linnaean system, those by \\nThunberg, seem to be the chief He has reduced \\nthe number of classes to twenty, by referring the \\nplants of the iOth, 21st, 22d and 23d classes to \\nothers, according to the number or connection of \\nthe stamina. \\nAll the plants which stand in the 20th class ought \\nto iiave the stamina placed upon the style ; but the \\nmost of the plants arranged by Linnaeus in thi^ \\n4 \\n\\nCLASSIFICATION. 177 \\nclass want these characters, the genus of Orchis \\nalone excepted, (§ 46, No. 7). The three follow- \\ning classes are not always constant with regard to \\nsex ; a difference of climate will sometimes remove a \\nplant from the class Monoecia to tliat of Polygamia. \\nLiLiEBAD has made the foUowins changes on \\nthe Linnaean system. He joins the 7th, 8th and \\n9th classes to the 10th. His Decandria thus con- \\ntains the Heptandria, Octandria, Enneandria and \\nDecandria of Linnaeus. The 1 1th class he joins to \\nthe ;Sth. The 18th, 21st, 2Sd, and 23d he in- \\ncludes in one. Thus his system contains only six- \\nteen classes, viz. \\n1. Monandria, 9. Polyandria, \\n2. Diandria, 10. Gynandria, \\n3. Triandria, IJ. Didynamia, \\n4. Tetrandia, 12. Tetradynamia, \\n5. Pentandria, 13. Monadelphia, . \\n6. Hexandria, 14. Diadelphia, \\n7. Decandria, 15. Syngenesia, \\n8. Icosandria, \\\\6. Cryptogamia. \\nSome other botanists have changed the orders of \\nthe 19th class, by leaving out the word Polygamiay \\nand removing the plants of the order Monogamia to \\nother classes. \\nBut this order of the l9th class ought to be alto- \\ngether suppressed ; because the genera belonging to \\nit have nothing in common with the other syngene- \\nsious flowers but the united antherae, which other \\ngenera, for instance, the Solanum, possess likewise. \\nIf this order be taken away the class becomes per- \\nfectly natural. \\nM \\n\\n178 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nScHREBER, in the last edition of the Genera Plan- \\ntarum, has changed the Orders of the 24th class, as \\nfollows : \\n1. Miscellaneae. \\n2. Filices. \\nS. Musci. \\n4. Hepaticae. \\n5. Algae. \\n6. Fungi. \\nIt would be superfluous here to take notice of \\nother alterations which do not tend to the improve- \\nment of the science. \\nThe last Order of the Nineteenth Class, Mono- \\ngamia, I have omitted, and transferred the genera \\ncontained in it to the fifth Class, where there are \\nmany genera with united antherae to be found. \\nThe order Syngenesia in the 21st and 2 2d Clas- \\nses I transfer to the Order Monadelphia, because \\nthe plants there enumerated have neither com- \\npound flowers nor united antherae. \\nThe order 1 rioecia in the 23d Class I likewise \\nstrike out, and bring to the foregoing one, because \\nthe plants of that order have, for the most part, || \\nthe same variety of sex. The orders of the 24th \\nclass 1 have totally changed and called them, \\n1. Stachyopterides, 5. Hepaticae, \\n2. Filices, 6. Algae, \\n3. Hydropterides, 7. Fungi, \\n4-. Musci, 8. Gasteroniyci. \\n\\nCLASSIFICATION. \\n179 \\n1. The Stachyopterides at emerging have the \\nfrond straight, that is, not rolled up, and their fruit \\nstands either on a spike, or between the leaves. Their \\nappearance, even when the fruit is not supported on \\na spike, resembles that mode of fructification. \\n2. The FiLiCES have at emerging their frond roll- \\ned up, and their fructification is on the back of the \\nfrond, seldom in a panicle, and still seldomer in a \\nspike. \\n3. The Hydropterides have a flat frond, which \\nis not rolled up, except in Pilularia, and their fruc- \\ntification is seated on the root. \\n4. The Musci have a thickly foliated stem, and \\nbear a llieca, {§ 1 13). \\n5. The Hepaticae have a flat frond, and their \\ncapsule in general separates into valves. \\n6. The Algae have a frond variously formed, and \\ntheir fruit is either lodged in a Thalamus, {§ 121), \\nor placed under the covering membrane. \\n7. The Fungi are of various appearance, fleshy, \\ncoriaceous or woody, and the fruit is lodged in their \\nsubstance. \\n8. The Gasteromyci are hollow and iniirely fill- \\ned with seeds, seldom with thalami. {§ 121)- \\n§ 146. \\nBesides the knowledge of different systems, it is \\nvery useful for a beginner to have some idea of the \\nnatural affinities of plants. He is thus, in the in- \\nvestigation of unknown plants, more easily led into \\nthe right track. We are indeed far behind in this \\nbranch of knowledge, and the little we know is \\nM 2 \\n\\n180 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nvery imperfect : but that little may be of great assist- \\nance to us in the investigation of plants, because bo- \\ntanists in their descriptions often make use of ex- \\npressions by which plants of particular allied fami- \\nlies are ascertained. Linnaeus has left us the follow- \\ning arrangement of Natural Orders : \\n1. Palmae, J 125, 7. \\n2. Pipeiitae. The flowers of this order are crowd- \\ned into a close spike, as Piper, Arum, &c. \\n3. Calmariae. To this order belong all the \\nGrass-like plants, which differ from the true Grasses \\nby their unjointed stem, such as Typha, Sparganium, \\nCarex, Schoenus, &c. \\n4. Gramina. All the proper Grasses, J 125. 5. \\n5. Tripetaloideae. These have either three petals, \\nor the calyx has three foliola, as in Juncus, Alis- \\nma, &c. \\n6. Ensatae, Lilies, whose leaves are ensiform or \\nsword- shaped, and their corolla, monopetalous, are \\nof this order, as Iris, Gladiolus, &c. \\n7. Orchideae, whose roots arc fleshy, but the \\nflowers are either furnished with a spur or with a \\ncorolla of a singular construction, ^83. The fila- \\nments and style are united, and the germen is below \\nthe flower. \\n8. Scitamineae have a herbaceous stem, very broad \\nleaves, a three-cornered, or at least a blunt-cornered \\ngermen, under a liliaceous corolla ; as in Amomum, \\nCanna, Musa, &c. \\n9- Spathaceae, are Lilies, which have their flowers \\ncontained in a large spatha ; as in Allium, Narcis- \\nsus, &c. \\n\\nCLASSIFICATION. \\n181 \\n10. Cofmariae, Lilies that have no spatha, but \\nhave a corolla with eix petals ; as in Tulipa, Orni- \\nthogalum, Bromelia, &c. \\n11.

Inundatae^ grow under water with flowers of \\nno beauty, as Hippuris, Zanicheliia, Ruppia, Potamo- \\ngeton, &c. \\n16. Calyciflorae^ that have only a calyx, in which \\nthe stamina are inserted, as in Eleagnus, Osyris, Hip- \\npophae, &c. \\n17. Calycanthema.

BOTANICAL APHORISMS. \\n§ 148. \\nThe true knowledge of Plants consists in the art of \\narranging, distinguishing, and naming them ; and \\nthis art depends on (he establishment of fixed rules, \\ndrawn from nature herself. The nature of arranging \\nplants is called System or Classification, of which \\nive have treated in the preceding chapter; but that \\nof distinguishing them must be further elucidated. \\nFor this purpose we must have an accurate know- \\nledge of the Terminology, that we may be able to \\napply it properly, and to employ the rules which \\nhave been framed from a consideration of the struc- \\nture of plants. Tliis knowledge is to be acquired \\nby an accurate investigation of flowers and a fre- \\nquent inspection of plants generally considered. \\nMethod, (method\\'us)^ or the knowledge of plants \\nfrom a consideration of the flower and its internal \\nstructure, is the proper business of a botanist ; but \\nthe knowledge of the external figure, (habitus)^ is an \\nassistance for facilitating the former, which he must \\non no account neglect. \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHORISMS. \\n187 \\n§ 149- \\nThe flower and fruit are the most constant parts of \\nplants, and therefore on them should a System be \\nbuilt, and from them should the characters be select- \\ned. Some botanists have employed the leaves for \\nthis purpose ; but experience shows how fallacious \\nsuch a system proves. As the flower is the chief \\nfoundation of System, it affords likewise characters \\nfor estabhshing the Genera. The Species, however, \\nmust be distinguished by other characters, (§ 1 86, — \\n193), than those taken from the flower. \\n§ 150. \\nThe first rule, which naturally arises from the \\nforegoing observations, is this, that the characters \\nof the class must never be the same with those of \\nthe orders, nor the characters of the orders the \\nsame with those of the genera ; but that the genera, \\nwhich stand under one order and class, must possess \\nthe characters of these without exception ; as for in- \\nstance the potatoe, Solamim tuberosum. This plant \\nstands in the fifth class of the System of Linnaeus \\nand first order : the characters of the fifth class are \\nfive stamina, and of the first order one style: the \\ngenus Solanum has the following characters : a quin- \\nquefid calyx, a wheel-shaped corolla, and a bilocular \\nberry with many seeds. Thus if we place the discri- \\nminating character of the genus in its having five \\nstamina and one style we would transgress the rule, \\nfor these characters are common not only to the ge- \\nS \\n\\n188 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC \\niius Solanum, but to all those plants which stand un- \\nder the same class and order*. \\nJ 151. \\nGenus is a number of plants which agree with \\none another in the structure of the flower and fruit, \\n(J 1£3). To distinguish the genera, we describe \\nthe flower and fruit, and such description is called \\nthe character : this is threefold, the natural, the fac- \\ntitious, and essential, (character mtui^alisjactitiusy et \\nessentialis J. \\nThe natural character, ( character naiuralisj, is a \\ndescription at large of the flower and fruit of a plant, \\nmade according to the rules of Terminology, and ser- \\nving for all the plants of a genus. Such a descrip- \\ntion it is very difficult to make ; but when once ac- \\ncomplished, it tends to the perpetual ascertainment \\nof the w hole. \\nThe essential character, f character essentialis J, is \\na very short description of the whole genus, which \\ncontains only the character which essentially distin- \\nguishes it from every other. \\nThe factitious character, (character factitius)y is \\nan essential character, but where the number of the \\nparts or some other circumstances, not of essential \\nimportance, are taken into it. \\nThe essential character is of great importance in \\nthe accurate investigation of a plant, and when it is \\n♦ There arc, to be sure, some exceptions to this ; for ex- \\nample, when there occurs an additional stamen or pistillum ♦ \\nbut this exception will be noticed afterwards, (§ 162.) \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHORISMS. \\n139 \\nobvious and distinct it tlirows great light on the \\nknowledge of plants. The factitious character is \\nonly to be used when genera contain too great a \\nnumber of species, so that it becomes necessary to \\nsubdivide them ; but where it is possible this ought \\nto be avoided. \\nThe essential and artificial character must be in- \\ncluded in the natural ; when this is not the case \\nsome of them must be defective. \\nKeeping our former example of the Solanum, we \\nshall, in technical language, exhibit its characters- \\nSOLANUM. \\nCalyx, perianthium monophyllum, quinquefi- \\ndum, erectum, acutum, persistens. \\nCorolla, monopetala rotata. Tubus brevissi- \\nmus. Limbus magnus quinquefidus, reflexo-planus, \\nplicatus. \\nStamina, filamenta quinque, subulata, minima. \\nAntherae oblongae, conniventes, subcoalitae, apicc \\nporis duobus deliiscentes. \\nPiSTiLLUM, germen subrotundum. Stylus filifor- \\nmis staminibus longior. Stigma obtusum. \\nPericarpium, bacca subrotunda, glabra, apice \\npunctato-notata, biiocularis. Receptaculo utrinque \\nconvexo carnoso. \\nSemina plurima subrotunda, nidulantia. \\nThe above extended description is called a natural \\ncharacter, and is taken from the plant : any varieties \\nof species are generally described separately. When \\nwe compare this natural character of the Solanum \\nwith others of the same class and order, particularly \\n\\n190 \\nPRINCIPLES OP BOTANY, ETC, \\nwith the allied genera of Capsicum, Physalis, &c. \\nthe following discriminating character arises : \\nSOLANUM. \\nCorolla retata. Antherae subcoalitae, apice poro \\ngemino dehiscentes. Bacca bilocularis. \\nThis essential character will easily distinguish the \\ngenus Solanum from the rest. But suppose there \\n■was found a plant which had all these characters, but \\nhad a berry that was quadrilocular ; if we were to \\nmake of this plant a separate genus, the character \\nwould be factitious ; for, as we shall show afterwards \\n(} 162, 163), the plant would notwithstanding belong \\nto the genus Solanum. \\n§ 152. \\nNature has connected, as we have seen, {§ 123), \\neach particular plant with others, by certain affinities \\nor resemblances. These resemblances are the foun- \\ndation of the genera. But it is obvious that on this \\naccount the genera are not really in nature, but ima- \\ngined by botanists, as assistances to the knowledge of \\nplants. Genera must be founded only on the flower \\nand fruit ; but the resemblances which we observe in \\nplants are not confined merely to these, but are found \\nin every other part of the plant. \\n§ 153. \\nThe establishment of genera is a necessary step \\nin the science ; and to attain the knowledge of them \\nwe must attentively consider the whole structure of \\nthe flower and of the fruit. This, structure is \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHORISMS. \\ncither natural, ( structura naturalissima J, or varied, \\n(differensjf or, lastly, particular, (singuUiris). \\n§ 154. \\nThe structure is to be considered according to its \\nnumber, (numerus) ; figure, (Jigura) ; situation, (si- \\ntus) ; and proportion, (proportio) : and by these we \\nobserve whether it is natural, varied, or particular. \\nIn genera we must always be attentive to number, \\nfigure, situation, and proportion; because without \\nthese no genus can be properly ascertained. On \\nthese are founded all ihe genera and most of the \\nrules which, in the sequel, I shall lay down. \\nJ 155. \\nThe natural structure, (structura naturalissima J, h \\nthat form of the fruit and flower which is most fre- \\nquent. In the natural character it is not used ; for \\nit serves only as a rule for the other kinds of struc- \\nture. The following is the most natural structure of \\nthe flower. \\nThe calyx is green, shorter than the corolla, and \\nthicker; the corolla is tender, easily falls off, and \\nis surrounded by the calyx. The stamina stand \\nwithin the corolla, the antherae stand erect upon \\nthe filaments, the pistillum is in the middle of the \\nflower. \\nAs to number, the calyx and corolla are for the \\nmost part divided into five laciniae, the stamina are \\nfive with one style. The laciniae or foliola of the \\ncalyx and corolla are in general equal in number \\nwith the stamina. \\n\\n192 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nThe fluit always corresponds with the style; if \\nthere is but one pistillum, the fruit is unilocular ; if \\ntiicre are more, there are more cells in the pericarp. \\nThe form of the calyx in general is a cup with \\nerect foliola ; the flower is commonly more or less \\nfunnel-shaped ; the stamina pointed ; the pistillum is \\nfurnished Avilh a slender and pointed style with a \\nsimple stigma. \\nWith regard to proportion, the calyx is often \\nabout a third shorter than the corolla ; the stamina \\nand style are hardly longer than the calyx. As to \\nsituation, the calyx encloses the corolla, and the petals \\narc alternate with the foliola of the calyx. The sta- \\nmina stand opposite to those foliola. The pistillum \\nstands on the top of the germen. The seeds rest on \\nthe receptacle. \\nIn a natural structure it is further observable, that \\na monopctalous corolla has a monophyllous calyx, \\nand that a polypetalous corolla has a polyphyllous \\ncalyx. The corolla and calyx are seated on the re- \\nceptacle. In a polypetalous corolla the stamina stand \\nupon the receptacle ; in a monopctalous, they are in- \\nserted in the corolla itself. \\nThis natural character ought never to enter into \\ndescriptions. It would, for example, in the natural \\ncharacter of the Solanum, 161), be quite super- \\nfluous, to say, Cah/.v corolla minor y vh^idis, JolmceuSf \\ncorolla i€?iera, antherae pulvere Jlavo f arctac, ger inert \\npostjioresceuliam intumescens, <§\\'c. ; because all these \\ncircumstances are supposed in a natural description, \\nwhere we expect to find only discriminating cha- \\nracters. \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHOUISMS- \\n§ 156. \\nOur botanical knowledge would be very limited \\nif nature confined herself to the natural structure, \\nand had made all flowers and fruits according to one \\nform. But the contrary is the case, and we are \\ntherefore enabled to acquire a more extensive ac- \\nquaintance w ith the vegetable kingdom. Of this the \\nTerminology will serve as a proof ; it points out \\nto us the deviations of plants from the natural struc- \\nture ; and these deviations, when we consider mere- \\nly the flower and fruit, exhibit the varied structure, \\n( struct ura differens), of plants. This structure is \\nthe foundation of every genus ; all genera and their \\ncharacters depend on this structure and the natural \\none. \\nJ 157. \\nThe particular structure, ( structura s\\'mgularis J, is \\nthat which is directly opposite to the natural one, \\nand affords the most beautiful characters. When, \\nfor example, in a monopetalous corolla the stamina \\nstand upon the receptacle instead of being inserted \\nin the corolla, we call that a singular structure ; or \\n■when the nectaria stand between the corolla and the \\ncalyx, as in Wildenowia, instead of standing, as is \\nusual, between the corolla and the stamina. \\nSome other examples are delineated on the fifth \\nplate, which I shall here more particularly mention : \\nThe genus Cucullaria, fig. 112, 113, shows an \\norchideous flower, with the anthera inserted into a \\npetal. \\n\\nyiUNClPLES OF. BOTANY, ETC. \\nThe genus Rupala, fig. 115, has the lilaments \\nstanding at the point of the foHola of the calyx. \\nThe genus Lacis, fig. 116, has neither calyx nor \\ncorolla, but a very simple flower, consisting of many \\nstamina and one style. \\nDimorpha, fig. 126, appears with a single petal, \\nrolled up on the side. \\nDorstenia, fig. 12 J, has a common receptacle, set \\nclose with male flowers, fig. 124, and with female \\nflowers, fig. 1 25 ; and has a particular calyx. \\nSterculia, fig. 144, has a germen raised on a long \\nfoot-stalk, that is set with united filaments. \\nIn the same manner are found the flowers of Pe- \\nriploca, Asclepias, and Stapelia; fig. 83, 88, 89? 90, \\nSI, 92, 98, 99, 100. These are furnished with par- \\nticular organs which we have described with the \\nNectaria, and which quite cover the stamina with the \\nstyle. The stamina are singularly formed, the fila- \\nments are attached like forks to a cartilaginous bodv, \\nand bear at the tip of each an anthcra. \\nTwo genera are remarkable for the particular \\nstructure of the floral leaf, namely Ascium and \\nRuyschia. The former, fig. 1 1 7, has an ascidiform \\nstipitate floral leaf, (bractea ascid\\'ij\\'ormis stipitata)y \\nwhicii stands close behind the flower. The latter has \\nan ascidiform sessile hv^ctcdi, ( bractea asc\\'uUj\\'ormis \\nsessilis), furnished with two lobes, (biloba), which \\nsurround the flower behind. \\nThese few instances are sufficient to show that the \\nflowers above-mentioned have a particular structure, \\naltogether different from the common one. Many o- \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHORISMS \\n105 \\nother examples will be found by attentive dissection \\nof flowers. \\nf 158. \\nFrom the singular structure of plants may be de- \\nduced the aphorism, that those genera, wliich have \\nthis singular structure, are more easily ascertained \\nthan those that come near to the natural structure. \\nThis last extends over all tiie natural families of the \\nvegetable kingdom. The umbelliferous plants, the \\nlilies, the papilionaceous flowers, the cruciform and \\ncompound flowers, are, on account of the similarity \\nof their structure, with difficulty distinguished. For \\nascertaining with facility the genera of every kind, \\nrules have been laid down which must be adapted to \\nnew-discovered plants. There are rules which in \\ngeneral are applicable to all plants, and others that \\nregard only particular families. But the genera are \\nto be distinguished by the structure of the flower and \\nfruit ; not by that of the root, leaves, or inflores- \\ncence. \\n§ 159\\' \\nThe flowers and their several parts have already \\nbeen described in the Terminology ; and that these \\nare not constantly furnisiied with all the parts which \\nconstitute a perfect flower has also been mentioned, \\n{§ 721). But there are cases, where, when the flower \\nhas only one external cover, it is diflicult to determine \\nwhether that cover should be named calyx or corolla. \\nIt is therefore oecessary to establish some rule to be \\nN 9 \\n\\n196 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANV, ETC. \\nmade use of in doubtful cases, that we may not err ift \\nascertaining a genus. \\nHedvvig was of opinion that the calyx and corol- \\nla should not be distinguished, but that both should \\nhave the same name. According to him the calyx \\nshould be named Pei^igonium e.rtemum, and the \\ncorolla Peiigoiiium internum ; and in cases where \\nthere is a double calyx, the inner one should be \\ncalled Perigonium intermedium. In doubtful cases \\nthis might do very well ; but where both parts are \\npresent it would give us no accurate idea of their \\nform. \\nScopoli proposed, to avoid any mistake, that when \\none part only was present, it should have the name \\nof calyx. But this rule errs against all analogy ; for \\nLilies have but one part, which is very delicate, and \\nwhich, by any person the least acquainted with plants, \\nwould be considered as a corolla. \\nLinnaeus gives the following rule in this case: \\nWhen one part only is present, and the stamina \\nstand opposite to the foliola or their lacinae, he \\ncalls this a calyx ; but when they stand alternately \\nwith these, he calls it a corolla. Li a plant which has few \\nstamina, and no more than there are laciniae or foliola \\nin the part present, this rule, which is founded on the \\nnatural structure of flowers, may answer the purpose; \\nbut when the number of stamina is double, or greatly \\nexceeds that of these laciniae, the rule can be of no \\nuse. In such cases, that part which is shorterthan \\nthe stamina, of a green colour and firm substance, \\nshould be named calyx ; but if it be longer than the \\nstamina, if it be coloured, and of a tender substance, \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHOIUSMS. \\n197 \\nand does not remain till the maturation of the fruit, \\nit is to be called corolla. \\n§ 160. \\nIn constructing new genera, it is necessary, that \\nthe essential character be applicable to all the species \\nof the genus, and be subject to no variation. \\nAs the flower and fruit of one species are formed, \\nso must those of all the rest be. For example, the \\nfruit of one cannot be a berry and of another a dru- \\npa, though Linn6 has committed this mistake in the \\ngenus lihamnus, which properly makes two distinct \\ngenera, namely, Rhamnus and Zizyphus. \\nJ 161. \\nThe character of a genus must be formed from the \\nnumber, figure, situation and prop07\\'tion, (§ 154), of \\nthe fower and fruit. \\nIt is only these circumstances, taken together, that \\nconstitute genera ; taken separately, they are of no \\nconsequence. There are often species, which de- \\nviate from the generic character in this or that par- \\nticular; but on that account they are not to he con- \\nsidered as distinct genera. \\n§ 162. \\nNumber alone can never co nstitute genera, and \\nmust never he considered as of any importance. \\nNothing is more subject to variation than the \\nnumber of the stamina. They are often very va- \\nrious in the same genus. Some plants, when they \\ngrow in a rich soil, acquire one or two additional \\nN 3 \\n\\n195 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nStamina and even additional petals. Often they arc \\nfound with double the number of stamina they \\nought to have ; for instance, a plant has ten sta- \\nmina that should only have five; or contrariwise, \\nit has only five stamina when it should have ten. \\nTwo often vary into four, three into six, four into \\neight, five into ten, six into tu\\'clve ; in this way the \\nnumber is either increased or diminished. When \\nthe structure of the other parts perfectly corres- \\nponds with another genus, and diiTers only in the \\nnumber of a part of the flower, whether it be calyx, \\ncorolla, stamina or style, it would be improper on \\nthat account to make it a new genus. \\n§ 165. \\nTFhen the number in all the parts of a fmver is \\nconstant, it may he used as a subordinate generic cha- \\nracter, but with great caution. \\nThis rule must be used with great prudence. If \\nit can be avoided, number must not be resorted to. \\nLinu6 has given one example of this rule in the \\ngenera of Potcntilla and Toruientilla, Number dis- \\ntinguishes these two artificial genera : the first has a \\ndouble pentaphyllous calyx and a pentapetalous co- \\nrolla. The calyx and corolla indeed remain con- \\nstant in their number in both genera ; but this ex- \\nample ought not to be imitated. \\n§ 1G4. \\nThe monophijllus and polyphylloiis cahj.v may cmi- \\nUitute genera ; but 7iot the number of lite laciniac. \\nN 4 \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHORISMS, \\n199 \\nor leaves. The same th \\'wg may be said of the co- \\nrolla. \\nThere are some families in which the cal^x is of \\nimportance ; but in these the number of the laci- \\nniae or foliola is not taken into account. If two \\nplants resemble one another, but the one has a mo- \\nnophyllous and the other a polyphyllous calyx, they \\nmust be considered as different genera. The reason \\nof which is, that a monophyllous calyx never \\nchanges into a polypetalous one ; but the number \\nof the foliola of a polypetalous calyx, or the num- \\nber of laciniae in a monophyllous one may be sub- \\nject to variation. The same rule applies to the co- \\nrolla. \\nf 165. \\nThe number of the stamina must be ascertained by \\nthat of the greatest number of Jlowers ; but if the \\nflower first evolved differs in number of stamina from \\nthe rest, we must reckon by it> \\nThe flowers of some plants are not always con- \\nstant in the number of stamina ; in this case we \\nmust be guided by the greater number; after, how- \\never, examining a considerable quantity of flowers. \\nSometimes, indeed, there appears a variety in the \\nnumber of stamina, the first evolved flower having \\nmore than the rest. In this case we must reckon \\nby the first flower, as it is in general the most per- \\nfect. In numbering the stamina it is likewise ad- \\nviseable to consider its affinity with other plants. As \\nexamples, we refer to Ruta, Monotrop^, and Ciiryj- \\nsosplenium. \\nN 4 \\n\\n200 TRINCIPLES OF BOTANT, ETC. \\n§ 166. \\nToo many genera are not to he made. \\nThis rule is one of the most important. Many \\ngenera are a manifest disadvantage to the science. \\nGeneric differences are not too nicely to be sought \\nfor. It is the first duty of a botanist to make the \\nscience as easy and attainable as possible ; but by a \\ntoo refined exhibition of generic distinctions he will \\ndo it more harm than good. \\nIf we consider as essential every small variation \\nin the structure of flower and fruit, the number of \\ngenera will be multiplied, and the difficulty of the \\nscience increased. To this fault those are most \\nprone who have seen fewest plants. When they \\nhave seen more, they will discover the intermediate \\nplants which unite the different genera, and thus be \\nforced to join what they formerly separated. I shall \\nonly here specify the genus Fumaria, several species \\nof wiiich have a differently formed pericarpium, but \\nwhich, by a judicious arrangement, all run into one \\nanother. Linnaeus himself has sometimes distin- \\nguished too nicely ; the difference he makes be- \\ntween Prunus and Amygdalus is improper; when \\nexamined strictly by the foregoing rule, these genera \\nought to be joined. \\n$ 167. \\nThe external appearance, (habitus), of all the spe- \\ncies of a genus, must Ukezvise he attended to, but 920 \\ngeneric characters taken from it. \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHORISMS. \\n201 \\nThis rule is to be taken with many restrictions, \\nlest by too rigid an adherence to it the science may \\nbe injured. In new genera we must take care that \\nthe habit does not agree with that of other genera ; \\nfor it often happens that a plant, supposed to be- \\nlong to a new genus, belongs to one ah-eady known, \\nand varies only in the number or figure of the parts \\nof the flower. \\nWhen a plant agrees in flower and fruit with those \\nof a genus already estabHshed, but is of a very dif- \\nferent habit, it must not on that account be separat- \\ned. An example will illustrate this : suppose a per- \\nson to discover a plant, which in flower and fruit \\nwas a perfect Tilia, but had an herbaceous stem and \\npinnated leaves : however much the habit might dif- \\nfer from that of the other species of Tilia, the plant \\nought to be referred to that genus. This example \\nis not really found in nature, but similar ones are \\nfrequent. To exemplify the rule I shall, however, \\ntake a real instance from the same genus. There is \\na tree in North America whose fruit agrees with \\nthat of our Tilia, but in the flower there appear be- \\nsides the petals, small petal-like scales ; the habit, \\nhovrcver perfectly agrees with that of the limetree ; \\nand as the flower differs only in that inconsiderable \\ncircumstance, the plant is properly referred to the \\ngenus Tilia. \\n§ 168. \\nThe regularity of the Jloxver is no certain generic: \\ncharacter. \\n\\n202 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANr, ETC. \\nThe relative length of the petals is not always \\nconstant, and tlierefore affords no proper generic \\ndistinction. Suppose plants were discovered that \\ndiffered only from one another in the irregularity of \\nthe flower, how undetermined would the science of \\nBotany become, if the genera were to be multiplied \\nfrom so trivial a circumstance ! \\n§ m \\nThe figure of the flower is akcays to he taken in \\npreference to that of the fruit. \\nThere are more genera, whose species agree in \\nthe flower, than there are whose species agree in the \\nform of the fruit. The older botanists were too at- \\ntentive to the fruit, which when it only differs in \\nexternal figure is of little importance. In the genus \\nPinus w\\'e have an apt example. Formerly several \\ngenera v\\\\ ere made of it, according as the fruit was \\nround, or long, or pointed, or obtuse, &c. The \\nnumber of the cells in a pericarp has likewise mis- \\nled souie botanists ; but these alone can never be a \\ndiscriminating circumstance ; as number 159) \\nnever affords generic characters. \\nj 170. \\nSlight mriatto7is in the figure of the floxver are of \\nno eonsequeiKc in establishing genera. \\nThe form of the corolla is very various, as we \\nknow from the Terminology : but there are many \\nkinds of it that very nearly resemble one another. \\nThis great resemblance shews evidently that the \\ntransition from one to another is but small, and \\n\\nBOTA.VICAL APHORISMS. \\nt03 \\nthat nature does not guide herself according to our \\ndistinctions. A funnel-shaped corolla easily passes \\ninto a salver-shaped one, and vice versa ; if genera \\nAvere to be formed upon such small circumstances, \\nthe number would become too 2»eat. In the eenus \\nConvallaria, the species Solomons seal, (C. Polij- \\ngonatum), has a tubular, the lily of the valley, \\n(C. majalis), a bell-shaped corolla. Hence we sec \\nthat these trivial variations of allied species of co- \\nrolla are of little consequence. But when plants \\nwith inonopetalous and polypetalous flowers are al- \\nlied, they must form separate genera. The form \\nof the corolla must be very different when it gives \\noccasion to form new genera. \\nI 171. \\nJVhere the fr uit in allied plants is very different, \\nthe genera must be separated. \\nPlants may agree perfectly in their flowers while \\nthey bear very different fruit. If the variety in the \\nfruit does not rest on the number of the cells or of \\nthe seeds, or on the form of these alone, the plants \\nmust form distinct genera. The example already \\nbrought from the genus Rhamnus iGO), aflxjrd-s \\na proof of this. The genera Abroma and Theo- \\nbroma differ only In the fruit. Such distinctions arc \\nvcrv beautiful, and ought never to be overlooked, \\nJ 172. \\nThe Nectarium affords the best generic character. \\nWhen the nectarium, on account of its singular \\nfigure, di^tinnuishcs one flower from another, it is \\n\\n204 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANT, ETC. \\nan excellent character. But it must be remarked, \\nthat the structure of the nectary must be striking : \\nfor it would be improper to consider the Arenaria \\npeploides as a distinct genus, because there are glands \\nin the flower ; or to separate the American Tilia, \\n167), from the European, because there are \\nsmall scales in the corolla. But if, as in other \\nplants, there are nectaria of a cylindrical or filiform \\nfigure, such a singular structure ought not to be \\noverlooked. The rule is not of difficult observation, \\nfor there are but few exceptions to it. \\n§ 173. \\nThe figure of the style and of the filaments affords \\n710 generic character, ei\\'cept it is mry remarkable. \\nIt often happens, that the figure of the style and \\nof the filaments in some species of a genus is very \\ndifferent ; that the style and filaments are bent down, \\nor are otherwise of a peculiar figure ; but this, in \\ngeneral, is but of little importance. However, if in \\nany genus there is an essential difference in these \\nparts, as in Cordia, it deserves particular attention. \\nThe germen may be supported on a stalk within \\nthe flower, as in Euphorbia, Passiflora, Helicteris, \\nSterculia, &c. which is a striking character not to \\nbe neglected. Linne was induced by this stalk, \\n\"wliich is nothing more than an elongation of the re- \\nceptacle, to consider it as another style below the \\ngermen ; and he accordingly reduces various genera \\nof this kind to his class Gynandria, (J 142). \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHORISMS \\n205 \\n§ 174. \\nThe situation of the germen is an excellent generic \\ncharacter. \\nHowever similarily constructed plants may be, if \\nthe germen in one is above, and in another is below \\nthe calyx, they must form separate genera. There \\nis no instance known where this situation of the ger- \\nmen is subject to variation. A single exception is \\nfound in the genus Saxifraga; where in some spe- \\ncies the o-ermen is under the calyx : in some it is \\nhalf above and half below, and in others it is wholly \\nabove the calyx. But here we see the transition \\ndistinctly, and consequently this instance alone is an \\nexception to the rule. \\nI 175. \\nThe situation or rather the insertion of the stamim \\nis of great importance in a generic character. \\nWhether the stamina are inserted in the calyx, \\nin the corolla, or in the receptacle, they afford a \\nprincipal character in establishing genera. Let the \\nconformity of the whole plant or flower be what it \\nmay, the genera must be determined by the inser- \\ntion of the stamina. In the caryophyllous plants, \\nparticularly in Lychnis and Silene, some filaments \\nare inserted in the receptacle, and some in the co- \\nrolla : these accordingly make one exception to the \\nrule. \\nJ 176-. \\nThe sex (sexus), of plants, can never serir as a \\ndiscriminating character of a genm. \\n\\n506 \\nPH2NC1PXES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nIf a plant differs from another in sex, this circum- \\nstance is not to be taken into the generic character, \\nat least it cannot serve any important purpose. We \\nhave already remarked, that no character is more \\nunsteady than that of sex ; for hermaphrodite flowers \\nare often by culture changed into male and female \\nflowers, and even difference of climate produces the \\nsame effect. For instance, in our garden, the Cera- \\ntonia siliqua is constantly observed with perfect \\nflowers, of different sexes on different trees, (Dioe- \\ncia), though in Egypt it is constantly found with \\nhermaphrodite flowers. Many genera, as Lychnis, \\nValeriana, Cucubalus, Urtica, Carex, &c. have \\nirpecies with hermaphrodite flowers, though all the \\nrest are dioicous. \\nFlowers that are of neither sex, (Jlores neutjij \\nhaving neither stamina nor style, and which arc \\nfound between fertile flowers, as m Viburnum and \\nHydrangea, cannot serve as generic marks. The \\nplants of the Jyth class form the only exception. \\nHitherto we have only stated the rules that are \\ngenerally applicable to all the fomilies of the ve- \\ngetable kingdom. There are, however, particular \\nrules for single plants that ^ve must here take notice \\nof Whoever attends to them and to the rules al- \\nready laid down, will find no ditBculty in charac- \\nterizing genera. Particular rules niight be given for \\nall the natural families, but it is suflricient to specifv \\nthe most important. \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHORISMS. \\n207 \\n§ 177. \\nThe Grasses, (ij 125, No. 5), have too great a \\nsimilarity in their whole structure not to make it ne- \\ncessar}\\' to select particular rules for ascertaining the \\ngenera. The number of the stamina, the presence \\nor want of an arista, can by no means serve either \\nfor separating or for establishing genera. The num- \\nber of the flowers, of the valves, and of the style, \\nhowever, should not be neglected : there is hardly \\nany thing else that aflbrds better distinguishing \\nmarks than these ; and, being steady, if they were \\nto be overlooked, the genera would grow too large. \\nThe Involucruni, which is found in some grasses, \\nafl\\'ords various characters that ought not to be reject- \\ned, as does likewise the form of the valves and nec- \\ntaiia. \\n§ 178. \\nThe Lilies, (§ 125, No. 6.), must be distinguish \\ned by the spatha, according as it is one or many \\nleaved, one or many-flowered : and also which hap- \\npens in few other plants, the stigma, the duration \\nof the corolla, and the direction of the stamina serve \\nfor distincfuishing genera. We must likewise observe \\nwhetiier the stigma be divided, and how often ; \\nwhether the corolla falls oflf, grows dry, or is per- \\nsistent ; lastly, whether the stamina are erect or bent \\ndown ; or take an oblique direction. In this, as well \\nas in the other natural families, the general rules \\nalready laid down are at the same time to be ob- \\nserved. \\n\\n208 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\n§ 179. \\nThe umbelliferous plants, {§ 146, No. 45), have, \\nof ail the natural families, the greatest resemblance \\nto one another. They are all furnished with a pen- \\ntapetalous corolla, five stamina, an inferior germen, \\ntwo pistilla; and even the mode of florescence and \\nthe fruit, which consists of two naked seeds, are si- \\nmilar. Linnaeus imagined he had found a discri- \\nminating circumstance in the general and partial in- \\nvolucrum, 55), by which the genera were to be \\nascertained : but this part is subject to great varia- \\ntion, and can in very few cases afford a good cha- \\nracter. Another difference has been found in the \\nfruit. Though this always consists of two naked \\nseeds, yet their figure is remarkably diffierent ; and \\nupon this alone are founded the generic characters \\nin the natural order of Umbelliferae. \\n§ 180. \\nIn the labiated and ringent flowers, or the whole \\nfourteenth class of the Linnaean System, (§ 142), \\nthe genera are established on the corolla, the calyx, \\nand the direction of the stamina. In the first or- \\nder, J 43), the fruit, which in the whole is simi- \\nlarly formed, affords no character, any more than \\nthe style, for in most the fruit consists of four \\nnaked seeds ; the pistilluHn consists of a simple style \\nand a bifid stigma. It is the laciniae of the calyx, \\nthe variously formed lips of the corolla, and, in a \\nfew genera, the direction of the stamina, which in \\njpost lie in the upper lip, that afford characters in \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHORISMS. \\n20.9 \\nthis family. In the second order, 143), the \\nfruit, Mhich is still more different, atTords a num- \\nber of characters for distinguishing genera. It is \\nremarkable in this family, that some of the plants \\n\"vvant a lip ; tliose in the first order -wanting the \\nupper, and those in the last the under hp. Teu- \\ncrium and Ajuga may serve as examples of the first \\norder ; Tourettia and Castilleja of the second. The \\nScordium of Cavanilles, which has an upper but no \\nunder lip, is an exception, as it belongs to the first \\norder. \\n§ 181. \\nThe cruciform flowers, or the plants belonging to \\ntlie fifteenth class, {§ 142), on account of the great \\nsimilarity of their parts, are with the greatest diffi- \\nculty distributed into genera. It is the fruit alone \\nwhich can distinguish them, and sometimes the \\nnectaria in the flower ; the calyx very seldom,, and \\naccording as it stands out or is close applied. The \\ncorolla may likewise afibrd a distinguishing charac- \\nter, but is in all similarly formed, and the single \\ngenus Iberis appears with two petals shorter than \\nthe rest. \\n§ 182. \\nThe Papilionaceae, or those of the l/th class, \\n{§ 142), are likewise very similar both in flower \\nand fruit. The calyx is in them the most mi{..ortant \\npart. The characters from the corolla are less de- \\ncisive ; for they ciepead on the proportion of its \\nparticular parts, or on their situation. Such cha- \\nracters are not to be recommended, except where \\n\\n•ilO miNClPLES OF BOTANY, ETC \\nno better can be had, or when the situation and \\nproportion are very remarkable. The connate sta- \\nmina are of little importance, but the stigma makes \\na very proper distinctive mark. Whether the fruit \\nin most of these plants be a legumen or a lomentum, \\nit differs very much in figure : and according to the \\niWure, cloathinor, or number of the seeds it contains, \\nmay the genera be determined. \\n§ 183. \\nThe compound flowers, or the 19th class, {§ 142), \\non account of their peculiar structure are subject to \\nvery different rules. In these, attention must be paid \\nto the common perianth, the receptacle, and the \\n}>appus. On these are founded the genera of this \\nwhole family. The sex, which LinnoDus employs in \\ntlie orders of this class, {§ 143), cannot be ap- \\nproved of in distinguishing the genera, and still less \\ntlie form of the flower. Many genera of this class \\nthat have no radius, nevertheless acquire it in favour- \\nable situations or in warm regions, and others in \\nlike manner lose it. A common plant with us, the \\nl>idens cernua, according to the generic character \\nshould have no radius ; but when it is found in very \\nwet slimy ground, it grows radiate. Linn^, who \\nhad seen both varieties, took the radiate plant for a \\nparticular genus, and called it Coreopsis Bidem. \\nHence it follows, that the genera Coreopsis and \\nBidcns are not different, except their separation \\nshould depend on the trivial circumstance above- \\nmentioned. We might here bring forward several \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHORISMS. \\nfill \\nOther examples, but they will easily be found upon \\nattentive investigation. \\n§ 184. \\nThe Cryptogamiae, {§ 142), or the plants of the \\n24th class, whose flowers are not obvious to the un- \\nassisted eye, must be determined by their fruit. No \\ncharacter of these plants should be taken that re- \\nquires a magnifier, and the character taken should \\nbe easily found. The flower of the cryptogamious \\nplants is of such a kind that it can be seen only at a \\ncertain time, often for a very short period, and with \\na high magnifier : in some it has not yet been dis- \\ncovered at all. It would, therefore, be a very great \\nerror to select for a generic character a part not \\neasily visible, and found with great difficulty. But \\nthe fruit is very easily seen, and may be examined \\nwith a moderate magnifier; so that it alone must \\ngive the character. We have not yet, however, suf- \\nficiently investigated the fruit in all the species of \\nCryptogamiae: there are consequently several gaps \\nin this class which remain to be filled up. \\nIn the Filices, Linnasus has assumed the mode of \\ninflorescence as the generic mark. In some of these \\nthe fruit stands in rows, in others in circles ; some- \\ntimes in the centre, sometimes in the margin or in \\nthe angles of the leaves. In other plants this cir- \\ncumstance is of no use, but in the Filices we are \\nobliged to resort to it. \\nThe character which Dr Smith has chosen for \\ndiscriminating the genera in the Filices is the In- \\ndusium, \\'{§ 6{). As this character is easily seen, \\no 3 \\n\\nillSi i\\'RlNCiriES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nlie observes how it separates, and in what order \\nthe seed-capsules under it are placed. In other \\nFilices, that have not their fructification on the \\nback of the leaf, we must resort to the figure of the \\nfruit. \\nThe Musci frondosi, {§ 125), have of late been \\nvery accurately investigated, and their flowers and \\nfruit are known : we are therefore now able to dis- \\ntinguish their genera better than formerly, the cha- \\nracters of which are taken from the peristoma, \\n{§ 113. d). This organ affords a number of cha- \\nracters, that are steadily and easily seen. \\nThe JMusci hepatici, {§ 125), are also arranged \\nin genera by the fruit, according to the mode in \\nw hich it opens. \\nThe Algae, (§ 125), have their genera ascertain- \\ned according to the form of the fruit, so far as this \\nis known ; but the external form must not be em- \\nployed for this purpose. \\nThe Fungi, 126), when their fruit has been dis- \\ncovered, will be distinguished by it ; but where that \\nis unknown, or does not aftbrd sufficient characters, \\nwe must have recourse to their external appear- \\nance. \\n§ 185. \\nA SPECIES means each particular plant standing \\nunder a genus, which continues unchanged when \\nraised from seed. A variety, ( varietas ), is a plant \\ndiffering in colour, figure, size or smell from a \\nknown species, which easily by seed returns to \\nthe particular species it arose from. Species that \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHORISMS. \\n213 \\nrequire great attention to be distinguished from one \\nanother, but which constantly remain the same \\nwhen raised from seed, are easily mistaken for va- \\nrieties ; and on account of the great resemblance \\nthey have to one another some botanists give them \\nthe name of subspecies. But all these may be \\ndetermined by the simple division into Species and \\nVarieties, and as this division is easily understood, \\nit seems superfluous to descend to Subspecies, V^a- \\nrieties must not be confounded with monsters, (mom- \\nstra); these are, it is true, varieties, with this dif- \\nference, thai they are not continued by seed. Dis- \\neased plants have likewise sometimes the appearance \\nof varieties; but they are easily distinguished, as \\nwe shall see hereafter. The various rules, accord- \\ning to which species are to be ascertained, are not \\nfounded on the flower or fruit, but upon other parts \\nof the plant. \\n^ 186. \\nIn distinguishing species regard is not to be had iu \\ncolour, sinell, taste, size, or to the external surf ace, viz. \\nwhether it be smooth or hairy. \\nWhen two plants differ from one another only in \\nthe colour of the flower, in having a different sincl! \\nor taste, in one being a foot, and the other a cubit \\nhigh ; or in tlie one having a smooth and the other \\na hairy leaf or stem ; such plants can be considered \\nmerely as varieties. If one plant differs from ano- \\nther in all these qualities together, it may pass for a \\ndifferent species. \\nWhite or black spots on the leaves of the plaui \\no ^ \\n\\n214 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\ncannot discrinfiinate species, and should only be taken \\ninto account when plants really difterent cannot be \\ndistinguished otherwise. But if a species can be \\nascertained without having recourse to colour, it is \\nalways better. \\nSmell and taste, as they are only comparative \\nqualities, cannot be received as specihc characters. \\nThe size depends so much on the quality of the \\nsoil that no regard can be had to it. The pubes\" \\ncence is exactly in the same circumstances ; for a \\nhairy leaf will become smootli in a different soil. \\nPlants with tomentose, spiny, or woolly leaves, or \\nstalks, are not so easily considered as Varieties, and \\nthese qualities afford the best distinctions. \\n§ 187. \\nThe root gives a beautiful and irjfallible mark for \\ndistinguishing species. \\nWhen the root in two similar plants is different, \\ntliey may be considered as different species. Culti- \\nvated plants are indeed an exception. Culture for \\na length of time, or the skill of a gardener, often \\ngive plants a very different appearance, as in the \\ncarrot, (Daucus Carota). In its wild state this plant \\nhas no large or yellow roots; it receives these only \\nfrom culture. But the above rule is applicable \\nsolely to wild plants ; however, if we can avoid \\ndrawing the specific character from the root, and \\ncan take it from other marks, it is so much the bet- \\nter, as we have not always an opportunity of exam- \\nining the root, particularly in a hortus siccus. \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHORISMS. \\n215 \\n§ 188. \\nThe stem affords a certain and obvious speci/ic dis- \\ntinction. \\nThe stem seldom varies, and therefore gives an \\nexcellent character; in particular the round stem, \\nthe cornered, the jointed, the creeping, &c. are \\nvery steady. The branched stem is not so sure a \\nmark ; it is very subject to variation, and therefore \\ngives no certain character. \\n^ 189. \\nThe duration of a plant is a proper distingidshing \\nmark of the species only in its native situation. \\nWhen allied or very similar plants differ in dura- \\ntion, so that one is an annual, the other a shrubby \\nplant, or even tree, they must be considered as dif- \\nferent species. But the duration of these, in the \\nplaces \\\\\\\\here they grow wild, must be investi- \\ngated. All plants that are biennial with us are an- \\nnual in warmer climates. Some that are perennial \\nin warm countries turn annual with us : the root is \\nkilled in our winters, and it must be restored by \\nsowing it again. Other perennial plants with us are \\nshrubs in warm countries, because no cold destroys \\ntheir stems. When thus the duration of a plant \\nexhibits any discriminating mark, the other species \\nmust be accurately examined to know whether they \\ntoo arc not of longer duration in a milder climate. But \\nif plants vary in this respect in the same region, such \\nmust be considered as different species ; for exam- \\nple, the Mercurialis annua and perentus resemble \\n04 \\n\\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC \\none another much, but the names express a distinct \\nspecific difference. \\nMost plants are distinguished fro??z one another by \\ntheir leaves. \\nAhnost all plants are distinguished by the various \\nform of tlieir leaves. But there are instances where \\nthis character will not answer ; for the umbelli- \\nferous, the compound, all the aquatic plants, figs, \\nand mulberries are an exception. In these the \\nleaves are subject to such considerable variations, \\nthat without much experience it is difficult to dis- \\ntinguish a species from a variety. When, there- \\nfore, there is uncertainty in the leaves, other cha- \\nracters must be resorted to. \\nI 191. \\nThe props, (fulcra), present certain specific cha- \\nracters, which are to be preferred to all others. \\nWhen plants differ from one another by their \\nspines, stipulae or bracteae, they may be considered \\nas distinct species. But it is to be observed, that \\nthese parts, if taken as specific characters, must not \\nbe subject to fall off. \\n§ 1^/2. \\nThe thorn, (spina), and the tendril, (cirrhus), arc \\nalways to be taken as certain characters. \\nThe tl lorn is nothing more than an indurated im- \\nperfect bud, which, when the plant grows in a lux- \\nuriant soil, changes to a branch. Pears, oran\\'^es \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHORISMS. \\n217 \\nand other plants in a poor soil produce thorns, \\nwhich leave them in richer ground. Some plants \\nthat have many thorns, retain them even in fertile \\nsoils. The prickle is very constant, and is never \\naltered by change of soil. In the same manner the \\ntendril changes in some plants with papilionaceous \\nflowers. We must first be perfectly certain that \\nthe thorn or the tendril are never wanting before we \\ndistinguish the species by them. \\n§ 193. \\nThe mode of injiorescence is the inost certain \\ncharacter. \\nWe have no instances of the mode of inflorescence \\nbeing subject to variation. When plants differ in \\nthis respect they are undoubtedly different species. \\nThe number of the flowers, that is, whether they \\nbe two, three or more, is an uncertain character. In \\ngeneral it may be observed, that nothing is so in- \\nconstant as number, and that it ought never to be \\nfounded on. \\nJ 194. \\nA species is never to be made a mricty, nor a \\nriety a species, on account of\\' any small difference. \\nWe shall see by the history of our science, that \\nin the 17th and in the beginning of the \\\\ 8th cen- \\ntury, every inconsiderable variety of a plant was \\nmade a species, which led to great error. It is a \\nrule, rather to take a plant for a variety than to \\nmake it too easily a species. \\n\\n208 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nA very different species may also appear a vari- \\nety, and therefore we must try it carefully by all the \\naforegoing rules; and if there still remain any \\ndoubt, we must set it down w here we think it is most \\nj)robable it should stand, with a point of interroga- \\ntion after it. \\n§ 195. \\nThe selected characters of a species must he con- \\nspicuous, in the varieties. \\nIf a plant is subject to great changes, the cha- \\nracters must be so chosen that they may be seen \\nin all its varieties. It would, therefore, be faulty \\nto separate a plant that commonly has a five-lobed \\nleaf, and varies with an entire leaf, from another \\nplant, merely on account of its five-lobed leaf. In \\nthis case we must seek for other characters, other- \\nwise the beginner, who has seen nothing but the \\nvariety, will never come to the knowledge of the \\nspecies. \\nS 196. \\nThe characters, hy which all the species of a genus \\nare distinguished^ must be taken from one or a few \\n\"parts. \\nIn a genus which has many species, if I should \\ncharacterize the first by the spike, the second by \\nthe leaves, the third by the stem, the fourth by the \\nroot, the fifth by the fruit, &c. no person with cer- \\ntainty would know the plants. \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHORISMS. \\n219 \\nIt is necessary to observe in the species of a genus, \\nwhat parts aiford the best characters, and if there \\nare many, they must be pointed out, and the dif- \\nferences remarked, that there may be no uncertain- \\nty or mistake. \\nJ 197. \\nIt is only at the time of flowerings or of ripening \\nthe fruit that characters should he taken. \\nNo botanist can with certainty distinguish plants \\nwithout flowers or fruit, otherwise he must by fre- \\nquent practice have attained a facility in distinguish- \\ning them by their leaves. Thus characters afforded \\nby plants before the developement of the flower or \\nthe ripening of the fruit are of no use. \\nI 198. \\nThe other characters by which species are ascer- \\ntained must be learned by experience. It is further \\nhowever to be remarked, that a description is to be \\nmade according to the rules of accurate terminology, \\nin the following order ; first the root, then the stem, \\nthe leaves, the fulcra, and lastly, the inflorescence. \\nIn a description, the colour of the flower is likewise \\nto be mentioned, but superfluous or unimportant \\ncircumstances are to be omitted ; such as that the \\nroot is under ground, that the leaves are green, &c. \\nThe old botanists frequently err in this respect. \\nf 199. \\nThe essential difference, or name, ( diagnosis), of \\n\\n220 \\nPRINCIPLES OP BOTANY, ETC. \\nthe species is a short description containing only \\nwhat is essential ; according to the following rules. \\nThe specific name must not be too long, and if pos- \\nsible should be contained in txvclve words. \\nWe have seen, 196), that in forming the spe- \\ncific name we must express only the essential differ- \\nence, and so characterise it, that he who sees the \\nplant for the first time, though he has never seen \\nthe other species of the genus, may be at no loss \\nto know what plant he has before him. Words \\nthat are superfluous, may be omitted, and only \\nthose made use of which [distinguish the plant from \\nall others. If more than twelve words are neces- \\nsary for the complete denomination of the plant, \\nthey must be adopted : for it is better that the name \\nbe long and distinct, than short and unintelligible. \\nThe specific name must be in the Latin language, \\nand all the words in the ablative case. \\nWe shall here recur to our old example, the \\nSolanum tuberosum ; the difference between which \\njand the other numerous species of the genus is ex- \\npressed as follows. \\nSolanum tuberosum; caule inermi herbaceo, fo- \\nliis pinnatis integerrimis, pedunculis subdivisis. \\nIn the specific name there must be no relative idea. \\nWhat was formerly said with regard to the dis- \\ntinguishing of the species is applicable here. Ma^r- \\n4 \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHORISMS. \\n221 \\nnitude, colour, &c. are not to be made use of, be- \\ncause these things can only be understood by com- \\nparison with other plants, and we have not always \\nat hand the object of comparison. The following, \\nwhich errs against this rule, may serve as an exam- \\nple. \\nSolanum arborescens, tomentosum, latifolium ; \\nfructu magno cinereo. Barr. aequin. 104. \\nWho can know from this character what plant is \\nmeant ? \\nThere must be no 7i€gative expression in the specific \\nname. \\nWhen in a specific name it is only said what the \\nplant has not, it is evident that nothing certain can \\nbe learned from it ; e. g. \\nCuscuta caule parasitico, volubili, lupuliformi, \\naspero punctato, floribus racemosis, non conglo- \\nmeratis aut pedunculatis. Krock Siles. 5251. \\nWhen a genus consists of but one species, there is\\' \\nno occasion for a specific difference. \\nIt is evident that a single species, that cannot be \\ncompared with another, can have no diseriminating \\ncharacter. Thus it is, in particular, with Butomus, \\nParis, Parnassia, &c. \\nBut when only one species of a genus is dis- \\ncovered, an accurate description must be made of \\nit, that it may be distinguished if others should be \\ndiscovered. \\n\\n2f22 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC \\n§ 200. \\nThe complete description of the natural charac- \\nters, {§ 151), of a genus, must be made in the fol- \\nlowing order ; First, the calyx, then the corolla, \\nthe nectarium, the stamina, the pistillum, the fruit \\nand the seed. In the compound flowers we end \\nwith the receptacle, and in the umbeliiferae we begin \\nwith the involucrum. A full description of the \\ngenus is contained in tlie essential character, the \\nrules for forming which have been already detailed. \\n§ 201. \\nVarieties, if they are not remarkable, deserve \\nlittle attention from botanists : but if they are of a \\nvery singular figure, they must be taken notice of \\nand described, that they may not be considered as \\nspecies.

It is remarkable, that the yellow colour pre- \\ndominates in the compound flowers, and in most \\nautumnal flowers. White is found chiefly in the \\nspring flowers ; white and blue principally in the \\nflowers of cold regions ; red and richly variegated \\ncolours in those of warm climates. White berries \\nare commonly sweet ; red, sour ; blue, sweet and \\nsour mixed ; and black, insipid or poisonous, \\n§ 204. \\nThough the botanist seldom trusts much to co- \\nlour ; yet it is of use to know in what way flowers \\nand fruits sometimes change from one colour to \\nanother. \\nIn general most colours pass into white ; the red \\n«nd the blue are most prone to change. It is not \\nP \\n\\n226 \\nPRINCIPLES OP BOTANr, ETC. \\noften that the change is made into yellow, or that \\nred passes into yellow ; blue very often turns to \\nred. We shall here give a few examples : \\nRed passes into white in \\nErica, Serpylluni, Betonica, Pedicularis, Dianthus, \\nAgrostemma, Trifolium, Orchis, Digitalis, Carduus, \\nSerratula, Papaver, Fumaria, Geranium, and many \\nothers. \\nBlue changes into zvhite in \\nCampanula, Pulmonaria, Anemone, Aquilegia, Vio- \\nla, Vicia, Galega, Polygala, Symphytum, Borago, \\nHyssopus, Dracocephulum, Scabiosa, Jasione, Cen- \\ntaurea, and many others. \\nYellow changes into white m \\nMelilotus, Agrimonia, Verbascum, Tulipa, Alcea, \\nCentaurea, Chrysanthemum, &c. \\nBlue changes into j^ed in \\nAquilegia, Polygala, Anemone, Centaurea, Pulmo- \\nnaria, &c. \\nBlue changes info yellow in \\nCommelina, Crocus, &c. \\nRed changes into yellaio in \\nMirabilis, Tulipa, Anthyllis, &c. \\nRed changes into blue in \\nAnagallis, &c. \\nWhite into red in \\nOxalis, Datura, Pisum, Bellis. \\nFruits, particularly the juicy kinds, often change \\nthen- colours. \\nBlack denies change into zvhite in \\nUubus, Myrtillus, Sambucus, &c. \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHORISMS. \\nBlack into yelloxo in \\nSolan um. \\nRed passes into zvhite in \\nRibes, Rubus Idaeus. \\nRed into yellcrw in \\nCornus. \\nGreen into I\\'ed in \\nRibes Grossularia. \\nBlack into green in \\nSambucus. \\nThe seeds of plants likewise frequently change \\nfrom one colour to another ; the poppy, ( Papaver J, \\nhas both black and white seeds. \\nThe seeds of papilionaceous flowers are most sub- \\nject to vary in colour. \\n§ 205. \\nThe leaves are in some plants naturally spotted ; \\nbut the spots are not always constant; they frequent- \\nly disappear altogether. Of this wc have examples \\nin the following : \\nLeaves ivith black spots. \\nArum, Polygonum, Orchis. Hicracium, Hypochae- \\nris. \\nLeases with zvhite spots. \\nPulmonaria, Cyclamen. \\nLeaves with red spots. \\nLactuca, Rumex, Beta, Amaranthqg. \\nLeaves \"with yelhnv spots. \\nAmarantlius. \\nThe leaves of some plants become red in autumn, \\nsl? those pf Rumex : others at times produce leaves \\np 12 \\n\\npRiNGirLEs or botant, etc. \\nwholly red, as Angelica, Fagus, Beta, Amaranthus. \\nMost plants change into yellowish green, light green \\nor dark green from excess of heat, or of cold, from \\ndefect in the structure of the vessels, or from va- \\nriety of soil and situation. From similar circum- \\nstances, the margin or centre of a leaf is subject to \\nchange. Gardeners are fond of such plants, which \\nthey call blotched. When the margin is yellow, the \\nleaves are called folia aurata ; when the centre has \\na yellow spot, they are called folia aureo-variegata ; \\nwhen the leaf is white on the margin, it is called \\nfol\\'mm argenteo, s. albo-marginatum ; when it is white \\nin the centre, it is called folium albo, s. argenteo- \\nvariegatu??i^ \\n^ 206. \\nBesides in colour, leaves change also in number, \\nbreadth, figure and parts. In number leaves change \\nonly when they are compound or opposite. They \\nvary often in breadth, so that an oval leaf, fre- \\nquently becomes oblong, &c. Culture often changes \\nthe figure of leaves, especially in rich soils. Of \\nthis we have an example in the common colewort ; \\nand other plants acquire sometimes waved or crisped \\nleaves. \\nThe different divisions of leaves often change re- \\nmarkably the appearance of a plant. The common \\nelder, (Sambucus iiigra), has sometimes finely cut \\nleaves. The alder, (Betula alnus), has likewise \\nlobed or divided leaves ; and many others are sub- \\nject to like varieties. Culture is the true touch- \\nstone of plants ; by frequent sowing the seeds we \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHORISMS. 2^9 \\ncan determine with certainty what are varieties, and \\nwhat are species. This is the only means of aniv- \\n, ing at the trutli. \\n^ 207. \\nWhen the student has become acquainted witii \\nthese rules, and by practice has attained a readi- \\nness in employing then), he will yet find difficulty \\nin determining plants he has never seen before. In \\nthis case the following directions are to be ob- \\nserved : \\nIn the first place he is accurately to examine the \\nflower, and endeavour to refer it to its class and \\norder, by attending to the number, proportion, and \\nconnexion of the parts of the fructification. When \\nhe has succeeded in this, he seeks out the genus in \\nhis system. Plere, however, he may encounter some \\ndifficulties, which he must carefully endeavour to \\novercome. \\nThe stamina, and likewise the pistillum, often vary \\naccording to the soil and climate in which the plant \\nhas grown, so that sometimes there is a stamen more \\nor less than there should be : in this case he must \\nexamine many flowers, and be ruled by the ma- \\njority. There is often likewise a luxuriance in \\nplants, which doubles the number of parts ; and often \\na defect, when a half is wanting : thus sometimes \\nthere are eight instead of four stamina, and some- \\ntimes only two. When in this case he cannot find \\nthe plant in the class where he thinks it ought to be, \\nhe must try the other classes where it may be. Some- \\ntimes the antherae and filaments are united, which is \\np .\\'J \\n\\n230 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nnot the case in other species, and the sex also is \\nsubject to variation. Therefore when a plant is not \\nfound in the class to which it seems to belong, he \\nmust search the 21st, 22d and 23d classes. If he \\nis convinced after these searches that the plant is \\nnew, he must describe it as such. Dr Roth and \\nProfessor Hedwiij have done an essential service to \\nbotany by making an index of the most frequent \\nvariations in the number and sex of different plants. \\nWhen one has been fortunate enough to discover \\nthe genus of an unknown plant he must proceed to \\ndetermine its species. He must compare the speci- \\nfic character, and never consider any plant as deter- \\nmined till he finds it agree with those laid down. \\nWhen these characters are not sufficient, he then \\ncompares it with the synonyma, to see if from them \\nhe can discover it with certainty. In the references \\nhe makes to authors Linnaeus has, after the page, \\nadded an asterisk (*) to those who have given a good \\ndescription of the plant, by which the further inves- \\ntigation is very much assisted. But when the plant \\nis obscure, or not certainly known, he distinguishes \\nit by a cross, (t). \\nThe duration of a plant he has marked after the \\nplace in which it is a native. If it be a tree or a \\nshrub, he marks it with this character, I? ; if a pe- \\nrennial with this, %; if a biennial thus, d< ; and if \\nan annual thus, 0. \\nIn the description of flowers, the following cha- \\nracters arc used to mark the sex. \\nA hermaphrodite flower, fjbs hermaphroditiis )^ ^ \\nA male flower, (Jlos vuisculus J, $ . \\n\\nBOTANICAL APHORISMS. \\n231 \\nA female flower, (Jbs femineus ) ? . \\nMale and female flowers upon one stem, (Jlores \\ninonoici) $ — ?. \\nMale and female flowers on diflTerent stems, (Jbres \\ndioici) i : 2. \\nNeuter flowers, (Jbj\\'es 7ieutri) \\nHennaphrodite and female flowers in one com- \\npound flower, (Jbres hermaphroditi et JemvieiJ, as \\nin the class Syngenesia $ | ? . \\nHermaphrodite and neuter flowers in one com- \\npound flower, (Jbres hermaphroditi et neutri)^ in \\nthe same class, 5 | ^ . \\nHermaphrodite and male flowers on one stem, \\n(Jbres poly garni ) $ — ^ . \\nHermaphrodite and female flowers on one stem, \\n(Jbres Holy garni) ? — ? , \\n\\nIV. NOMENCLATURE OF PLANTS. \\n§208. \\nIt appears to be of little importance to give a \\nplant a new name ; but it is certainly agreeable to \\none who makes botany his study, to find a name \\nthat is appropriate, and easily and generally receiv- \\ned. When the name is indeterminate and unsettled, \\nthe knowledge of the thing is lost. The old bo- \\ntanists were not much concerned about preserving \\nthe names of plants. Every one who turned author \\ngave them new ones, and thus in those times the \\nstudy of Botany was unpleasant and uncertain. \\nPersons were disgusted with the barbarous, dry and \\nunfixed nomenclature which prevailed, and declined \\nentering on the study of the most beautiful objects \\nof nature, on account of the difficulty and uncer- \\ntainty which attended it. But by the introduction \\nof fixed and generally received names, we are \\nnow able to make ourselves understood wherever \\nBotany is known. \\n\\nNOMENCLATUKE OF PLANTS. 233 \\n/ \\n§ 209. \\nTournefort, who undertook to reform the science \\nof Botany, established genera, and invented names \\nfor them : but the species were still distinguished \\nby short and often imperfect descriptions. The ge- \\nneric name was then, it is true, better defined, but \\nthe species were left still undetermined. In this, as \\nin every other department of the science of Botany, \\nLinnaeus has performed the most eminent service \\nby establishing a generic name, (nomen genericum), \\nand a trivial name, (nomen irhialej, to every plant. \\nThe rule by which these names are imposed is as \\nfollows : \\n§ 210. \\nEach genus must be dejincd and \\'properly denomi- \\nnated ; and every nexv genus must liketvise have a nexo \\nname, \\nA name once properly imposed, is not afterwards \\nto be changed. None but a botanist who is ac- \\nquainted with the names of all other plants, has a \\nright to impose a name, lest the same genus shouh! \\nreceive two different names. \\n§ 211. \\nGenerally received 7iames inusl be preserved ; and \\nwhen 7iew discovered plants txceive trto names from \\ndifferent botanists, the first that was imposed, if it \\nis a good one, must be adopted. \\nAs most botanists now follow Linnaeus, it is their \\nduty to preserve his names when they are applied to \\n\\n234 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC \\ntrue genera. In newly discovered plants, it often \\nhappens that two botanists, in different places, about \\nthe same time, give each a name to the genus. One \\nonly of these can belong to it, and therefore that \\nwhich was first imposed, if it is good, and formed \\nAccording to rule, must be received. For instance, \\nthe bread-fruit tree was described by Solander, by \\nForster and by Thunberg. Solander called it Sito- \\ndium, Forster Artocarpus, and Thunberg Radema- \\nchera. Forster\\'s name was the first and likewise \\nthe best, consequently it is that which is generally \\nreceived. \\n§ 212. \\nNames must not be too lotig. \\nIf the name of a genus is composed of many short \\nwords, it becomes too long and displeasing to the \\near. Some of the names given by the older botan- \\nists may serve as examples, viz. \\nGilophyllodendron. Orbitochortus. \\nCariotragcmatodendros. Hypophyllocarpodendron. \\nAcrochordodendros. Stachyarpogophora. \\nLeuconarcissolirion. Myrobatindum. \\nNames must not he taken f rem foreign languages^ \\nnor even from the European ; but, when it can be \\ndone, they should he formed from the Greek. \\nNames taken from foreign languages, even though \\nthey have a Latin termination, are improper, and \\neannot be so classically compounded as the Greek. \\nEven names fornied from the Latin are destitute of \\n\\nNOMENCLATURE OF PLANTS. \\n2S5 \\neuphony, and still more so when they are com- \\npounded of Latin and Greek together. When it is \\npossible they should be made out of two Greek \\nwords witli a Latin termination. The following arc \\nexamples of faulty names : \\nOut of the American languages. \\nAberemoa. Apeiba. Apalatoa. \\nBocoa. Caraipa. Cassipourea. \\nConceveiba. Caumarouna. Faramea. \\nGuapira. Heymassoli. Icacorea, \\nMatayba. Ocotea. Pachira. \\nPaypyarola. Quaypoya. Saouari. \\nTocoyena. Voucapoua.

The following are faulty in this \\nrespect. \\nTaxus, Onagra, Elephas, Ampelis, Natrix, Del- \\nphinium, Ephemerum, Eruca, Locusta, Phalangium, \\nStaphylinus, Granatum, Hyacinthus, Plumbago. \\nJ 215. \\nNames must not be received that are borrozved frovi \\nreligious, divine, moral, anatomical, pathological, geo- \\ngraphical, or other terms. \\nWhen we choose a name having a reference to \\nreligious or other matters, with which it cannot pro- \\nperly be compared, or which arc not known to \\nevery one, it is good for nothing. The following \\nnames are therefore faulty. \\nRclmovs. \\nPater noster. Oculus Christi. \\nMorsus Diaboli. Spina Christi. \\nFuga Daemoniim.

The pro - \\nperties of a plant, or its colour, do not afford good \\nnames, though sometimes recourse must be had to \\nthem : but when tlie names are taken from unsteady \\nmarks, such as the woolliness of the leaf or stem, \\nwhich is proper only to one species, they are to be \\nrejected. \\nThe following names arc taken from a single part of \\na \\'plant, and are not to be imitated. \\nCyanella ; on account of its blue tlower ; but there \\nare species with white and yellow flowers. \\nArgophyllum ; on account of its tomentose white \\nleaves. \\nGratiola ; for its use in surgery. \\nSamolus ; from the island of Samos, where it was \\nfirst found. \\n§ 217. \\nNames ending in oides, astrum, astroidcs, ago, el- \\nla, ana, must be carefully avoided. \\nBy these terminations the resemblances of plants \\nto others are intended, at the same time implying \\na doubt. Those names of this kind are especially \\nto be avoided, which are of a disagreeable or harsh \\nsound; such as, \\nAlsinoides, Lycoperdastrum, \\nAlsinella, Lycoperdoides, \\nAlsinastrum, Juncago, \\nAlsinastroides, Erucago, \\n» Alsinastriformis, Portulacaria, \\nAnagalloidcSj Breyniana, \\n\\nNOMENCLATURE OF PLANTS. \\nAnagallastrum, Ruyschiana, \\nClathroidastriim. \\n§ 218. \\nNames similar in sound nmst likewise be avoided. \\nA name may sometimes be very proper, but may \\nbe faulty in having nearly the same sound with ano- \\nther, and ought, therefore, to be changed, that it \\nmay not be mistaken in printing or speaking ; such \\nas, \\nConocarpus, Ambrosia, Gaura, \\nGonocarpus, Ambrosinia, Guarea. \\nf 219. \\nThe name of a class or order can iiever be received \\nas the name of a genus. \\nThe antients often use the name of a whole fami- \\nly for a single genus. This leads beginners inio er- \\nror, and one sometimes knows not whether a class \\nor a genus is meant. Thus we find Lilium, Palina, \\nMuscus, Filix, Fungus, &c. \\n§ 220, \\nThe highest reward of a Botanist is to have a genus \\ncalled after his narne. \\nNo monument of marble or brass is so lasting as \\nthis. It is the only way of perpetuating the memo- \\nry of true botanists, or of those who have benefited \\nthe science. \\nThe names of botanists must be preserved un- \\nchanged, only giving them a proper Lalin teri%jna- \\ntion ; a^, \\n\\nPllIXCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nLinnaea, Royenia, Thunbergia, Sparinannia, Gle- \\nditschia, Halleria, Buxbaumia, Retzia, Smithia, &c. \\nIf the name of the Botanist has a Latin termina- \\ntion, it must not remain so, but must end according \\nto the rules of art. Hence, the following, as names \\nof genera, are faulty, viz. Laguna, Senra, Milla, Cos- \\nmos, Acosta, Galinsoga : \\nThey would be more scientific thus ; \\nLaguiiaea, Senraea, Millea, Cosmia, Acostaea, \\nGalinspgaea. \\nIt is likewise improper to introduce the praenomen \\nof any Botanist into the generic name, as it is by this \\nmeans made too long ; e. g. Gomortega, from Gomez \\nOrtega. Still less ought the names of two Botanist? \\nto compose the name of a genus ; as Carludovica. \\n§ 221. \\nFor the better distinguishing of the species, Linn6, \\nbesides the generic name, contrived a second, which \\nhe called the trivial name, ( nomen triviale, § 222). \\nWith regard to this the following things are to be \\nobserved. \\n§ 222. \\nA trivial name inust he short, tmlike to the generic \\n7iame, and alzvays an adjective. \\nTrivial names are intended as a help to the me« \\nmory, and therefore if they are compound words \\nthey do not answer the end. It is likewise improper \\nto annex to a generic name, which is always a sub- \\nstai/five, another substantive. The following names \\no \\nare therefore faulty ; \\n4> \\n\\nNOMENCLATURK OF PLANTS. \\nS4I \\nCarex Drynieja, Juncus Tenageja, \\nChoidorhiza, Scirpus Beotiiryon, \\nHoleonaster, Lichen Aipolius, &c. \\nThe triviai name siiould always be an adjective, \\nand should, if possible, signify some quality of the \\nspecies ; as, Carex paniculata, Carex canescens, \\nCampanula patula, Campanula persicifolia, &c. \\n§ 223. \\nThe fgure, cloathing, and especially the specific \\ndiffertiice, suggest the most appropriate trivial 7iames. \\n^V hen the specific difference can be expressed in \\none word, and that an adjective, such a trivial name \\nalways deserves the preference. But the adjective \\nmust not be too long, nor consist of two words. When \\nsuch trivial name is not to be found, we must have \\nrecourse to the qualities, place of growth, and other \\ncircumstances. \\n^ 224. \\nThe colour and native country afford terij uncer- \\ntain trivial names. \\nIt cannot be known from the appearance of a plant \\nwhether it grows in this or in that country, nor whe- \\nther another species ma}\\' not likewise grow in the \\nsame place. Neither can it be known whether tho \\ncolour of a plant is constant or not. Trivial names, \\nfrom these circumstances, are not therefore to be re- \\ncommended. Linnaeus has Polemonium coerulemiy \\nthough it varies with white flowers. Euonymus eu- \\nropaeus is not the only European species of that ge- \\nnus ; the £. verrucosus and latijolius are both na- \\n\\n343 PKINCIPLES Of BOTANY, J5TC \\nlives of Europe ; and we might give other instances \\nto shew that such names are not good. \\n§ 225. \\nThe Botanist must attend to varieties when they \\nare considerable ; he must give them a second name, \\nand mark them with a Greek letter, e. g. Brassica \\noleracea. \\net. viridis, K. selenisia, \\n/3. rubra, yi. sabellica, \\n7. capitata, 6, botrytis, \\n^. sabauda, /. napobrassica, \\n£. laciniata, x. gongy lodes. \\nIn this way we can, in a few words, designate tlic \\ngenus, species and varieties of a plant, which the \\nolder botanists could not do without a long descrip- \\ntion. \\nThe great advantage of the Linnaean names is not \\nadmitted by some botanists, and therefore they have \\nattempted a change. First Ehrhart, considering that \\nthere are no proper genera in nature, but that these \\nare invented by the ingenuity of botanists, proposes, \\nin his Phytophylaceum, to denominate every plant \\nby one word ; thus, \\nCarex dioica he calls Polyglochin. \\npulicaris Psyllophora. \\narenaria Ammorrhiza. \\ncapillaris Caricella. \\npallescens Limonaetes. \\nhumilis B^eochortus, &c. \\n\\nN03IENCLATDRE OF PLANTS. \\n243 \\nKy such names the science would be immeasura- \\nbly burdened. Tfiere may be \\'about £1000 known \\ngenera, and at an average 80,000 plantis, which \\nmust all have their appropriate names. But -^vhat \\nmemory would be sufllicient for such a nomencla- \\nture? \\nThe idea of Wolff is of a very different nature. \\nHe proposes to distinguish every character of a plant, \\nwhether it be the figure of the flower, the stamina, \\nstyle, fruit, leaves, root, stem, stipula, florescence, \\nsmell, colour, &c. by a particular letter, so that the \\nname of every plant shall be composed of these let- \\nters, and thus shall convey an idea of its structure \\nand properties. However ingenious such a proposal \\nmay be it is impossible to execute it. One may ea- \\nsily imagine what barbarous words would be formed \\nby this method, and w hat a number of consonants \\nmight of necessity stand together, which no power \\nof utterance could pronounce. To attain any faci- \\nlity in such a nomenclature would require a life-time, \\nand the advantage, after all, would indeed be trifling. \\n§ 1227. \\nAs the trivial name of a plant is in most cases an \\nadjective, it must begin with a small letter ; as, \\nRhus glabrum, Lythrum virgatum, \\nHieracium subaudum, Eupiiorbia segetalis, \\nDianthus chinensis, Asclepias tuberosa, &c. \\nBut when the trivial name has formerly been the ge- \\nneric name of the plant, it must then begin with a \\ncapital ; as, \\nRhus Cotinus, Lythrum Salicaria, \\nQ 2 \\n\\n244 \\nrniNClPLES OF BOTAXr, ETC. \\nRhus Coiiaria, Lythrum flyssopifolia, \\nDianthus Armeria, Asclepias Viiicetoxiciim, \\nThe trivial name must always be written with a \\ncapital letter when it records the discoverer of the \\nplant ; as, \\nHieracium Gmelini, Euphorbia Gerardiana, \\nHieraciuni Kalniii, Erica Sebana, Sec. \\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n\\nV. PHYSIOLOGY \\n§ 228. \\nBesides the division into the three kingdoms of na- \\nture, (§ 2), natural bodies may be conveniently ar- \\nranged into two great classes, viz. organic and \\ninorganic bodies. Inorganic bodies are those, \\nwhich are composed of heterogeneous particles, che- \\nmically or mechanically combined, and which, even \\nwhen somewhat regular in their figure, are formed \\nby external apposition. Organic bodies, on the \\ncontrary, are those, which are regularly corhposed of \\nmany differently formed organs, which, in the natural \\nand healthy state, have the same structure with all the \\nindividuals of the same species. They grow larger \\nin outward appearance by the action of an internal \\npower, have a circulation of juices, and propagate \\ntheir kind, so that they are continually reappearing in \\nthe same form that has been once prescribed to \\nthem. Under organic bodies are comprehended ani- \\nmals and plants. \\n\\n246 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC \\nThe formation of organic bodies depends upon \\nthe diversity, of matter and form. In every investi- \\ngation, these are the hist points which occur to us, \\nuntil we resolve them into their fnst principles. \\nVital power or irritability is a property of organized \\nbodies, which is connected with their composition \\nand form ; but we are still unable precisely to deter- \\nmine, whether it is merelv the result of form and \\ncomposition, or whether it constitutes an independent \\npower : Experience, at least, in the vegetable \\nworld, seems to favour the former supposition. The \\nelements, and the matter compounded from them, \\nact upon organized bodies, and afford a sti- \\nmulus, by which activity or excitation is produced. \\nBy the increase and continuance of the stimulus the \\nirritability diminishes, and at last altogether subsides. \\nThus the same stimulus, that roused the irritable \\nprinciple to action, promotes the decay of the or- \\nganized body : consequently life is an exertion of vi- \\ntal power, by which a supply and combination of the \\nmatter belonging to the composition of the organized \\nbody, is constantly produced- Dy life, organized bodies \\nare farmed, increased, and supported, and by it the \\nparts which have been injured by accident are restored. \\nThe faculty of assimilation, of the power of loco- \\nmotion, and of reproduction, are therefore only \\nconsequences of life ; just as elasticity and contracti- \\nlity are properties of matter alone. Combinations \\nof matter in organized bodies, in consequence of the \\nin itable principle, are regulated by other laws than \\n\\nPHYSIOLOOr. \\n247 \\nthose of chemical affinity ; and when the vital power \\nceases, they are destroyed ; i. e. when the vital power \\nceases, the matter, of which organic bodies are com- \\nposed, is combined according to the laws to whi(;l) \\ninorganic bodies are subject. \\n§ 230. \\nElasticity, (elasticitas J, which is peculiar to the \\nmatter of organized bodies, appears both in the \\nliving and decayed state of vegetables. It is per- \\nceptible in the ligneous fibre, in resins, and other \\nparts and productions of plants. Contractility, \\n( contract Hit as s. vis mortua ), is chiefly peculiar to \\nwood. In economical use the expansion and \\ncontraction of wood are very troublesome proper- \\nties, which can be destroyed only by a particular \\nmode of treatment The dry stalks of Anastatica \\nHiejvchuntica, commonly called the rose of Jericho, \\nthe seed-vessels of the genus Mesembryanthemum, \\nmany species of which are known to gardeners by \\nthe name of the Candian flower, the dry calyx of \\nCarlina vulgaris, are in this respect the same as \\nwood. They expand in wet weather, and contract \\nwhen dry. \\nThe same observation applies to liverworts and \\nmosses, which during summer appear to be wither- \\ned, but in cool, moist weather, and in autumn, again \\nbegin to grow and expand. \\nThe contractility of ligneous fibres fits them for \\nbeing Hygrometers. Formerly it was thought that \\nplants could grow in breadth, only by the expansion \\nof the interstices between the fibres of the wood. \\nQ 4 \\n\\n\\'248 \\nPillNClPLES OF BOTAXr, ETC. \\nwhen moisture pervades them. Mr De Luc, how- \\never, has shown, that the fibres themselves may be \\nelongated, though in a small degree, and may again \\ncontract. And he has made the singular remark, that \\nbox-wood contracts its fibres longiludinally when \\nnioist, but elongates them in a dry amiosphere. It \\nhowever undergoes the changes in breadth in the \\nsame manner as other wood. He examined a great \\nnumber of different sorts of wood ; but not one show- \\ned the phenomenon of box-wood. That vegetables \\nas organized bodies are possessed also of vital powers, \\nadmits of no doubt, as is sufficiently demonstrated by \\ntheir growth, formation, and decay. On a few dif- \\nferent parts only the operation of the applied stimulus \\nbecomes visible. \\nThe leaves of Mimosa pndica, setisitka, casla, of \\nOxahs scmit\\'wa, Dionaea wAisdpiila, and other plants \\nwhich grow only within the tropics and under the equa- \\ntor, contract when touched. Less conspicuous, but \\neasily demonstrable, is the contractility in the indi- \\ngenous species of sun-dew, Drosera rotutidifoUa and \\nlongifoiia. The filaments of Urtica, Parictaria, Ber- \\nberis, and others show great irritability, and likewise \\nthe pistils of some plants, especially the stigma of \\nMartynia. According to some experiments, light \\nacts as a particular stimulus upon plants. \\nVegetables appear to be little susceptible of the \\npower of Galvanism. The result of the experiments \\nhitherto made, is so very dubious that we cannot \\nventure to advance any opinion upon this subject. \\nElectricity acts powerfully upon plants as well \\nas upon aniiTjals, and the effects which it produces \\n\\nPHySIOLOGY. \\n249 \\nin both are exactly the same : viz. Electricity, when \\nfaintly applied, is beneficial to their growth, but be- \\ncomes hurtful to them when exerted with any degree \\nof violence. Van Marum destroyed plants by \\nviolent electric shocks, and I myself made a similar \\nexperiment on the Drosera rotumlifolia. This plant \\nremained quite uninjured in the electrical bath, but \\nwhen I began to extract sparks from its leaves, it \\nsoon withered away. \\nThe power of reproduction, which is one of the \\nconsequences of Hfe, is common to animals and \\nplants. It is less perceptible in plants than in ani- \\nmals and worms. \\nSlight wounds in the cortex heal very easily, and \\nDuhamel, after he had, ^^fth the greatest care, com- \\npletely removed the bark of a tree, observed it again \\nbeginning to appear. With regard to plants of many \\nstamina, it has been alledged by some, that, imme- \\ndiately after the removal of the stamina, similar bo- \\ndies, though void of pollen, are reproduced. But \\nthis is not properly reproduction, because the parts \\nthus procreated are not of the same structure as for- \\nmerly. \\nThe leaf of a plant, which has been at all mutilat- \\ned, will never be renewed, neither will the leaves of \\nflowers, which have been injured, either in a perfect \\nor an imperfect state, ever be fully reproduced. If \\nwe divest a willow, or any other tree of its branches, \\nand the tree produce new ones, we cannot look up- \\non this as a reproduction, because the tree is a com- \\npound plant, {§ 232), and every branch, or rather \\neverv bud» can be considered only as a particular \\n\\n250 \\nrRlNCIPLES OF BOTANr, ETC \\nplant. Thus, then, the growth of the pruned branches \\nis a production, l)ut not a reproduction, for in the \\ngreater part of leaf-bearing wood, tlie whole surface \\nis capable of producing buds and branches. \\n§ 231. \\nPhilosophers have constantly endeavoured to dis- \\ncover resemblances between animals and plants. \\nAristotle called vegetables reversed animals. Lin- \\nnaeus pursued this idea still farther, but his lively \\nimagination carried him too far, when he denominat- \\ned heat, the heart, and earth, the stomach of plants, \\nand even when he, witii more justice, compared the \\nleaves of plants to the lungs of animals. Compari- \\nsons of this kind must always fail, as animals and \\nplants differ very materially in the form of the or- \\ngans of which they are composed. \\nBut the most successful on this head was the im- \\nmortal Bonnet, who, in a very ingenious manner, has \\ncompared the egg, the embryo, the nourishment, \\nand the generative organs of animals to those of ve- \\ngetables. \\n§ 232. \\nThis likeness which philosophers observed between \\nanimals and plants, cliicfly consisted in properties, \\nwhich organized bodies possess without respect to \\ntheir structure. It is, therefore, certainly worth \\n•while, to consider more accurately, in what respects \\nplants differ from animals. \\nAnimals take food by a certain aperture, and have \\na particular canal by which they propel their excre- \\nrnentitious matter. \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n251 \\nPlants, on the other hand, take in nourishment with \\ntheir whole surface, and except transpiration, which \\nthey possess in common w ith animals, have no pecu- \\nliar canal to expel their excrements, unless we con- \\nsider the drops which are found on the roots of some \\nluxuriant plants, as a proof of the contrary. Of this \\nmore shall be said hereafter. \\nPlants have a structure altogether different from \\nthat of animals. They consist of variously com- \\nh\\'med vessels, which are surrounded by a cellular \\nmembrane. The existence of muscles in plants has \\nnot yet been clearly evinced, nor have nerves hither- \\nto been perceived in them. The wood, which some \\nhave compared to bones, has certainly not the least \\nresemblance to them. \\nPlants consist of a cuticle, (epidermis s. cutis J, \\n(fig. 279, 280, 281), which appears in woody \\nplants to be converted into the outer bark, (cortex). \\nIt covers the inner bark, (liber), which is solely \\ncomposed of vessels. This is followed by the ill- \\nhimium, or the soft wood, as it is called. The \\nwood, (lignum ), is inclosed by the last, and sur- \\nrounds the pith, (medulla). \\nTi>e inner bark, alburnum, and wood, arc one \\nand the same substance at different periods of \\ncrotwh. The innerbark is converted into alburnum, \\nand this into wood. They are all three compressed \\nvessels, which are more or less hard, or still soft. \\nThe pith almost entirely disappears in very thick \\nlarge trunks, by the increasing solidity of the wood, \\nand only in a few plants remains uniformly through- \\n\\n252 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nout all parts of the trunk. We find it in herbaceoii? \\nplants, but most aquatic plants want it entirely. \\nThe stems of herbaceous ])lants have neither al- \\nburnum nor wood. The epidermis, which rarely in \\nthem is converted into bark, incloses a ring of ves- \\nsels, corresponding with what in woody plants is call- \\ned the inner bark. Immediately beneath this we have \\na more or less dense cellular membrane, ( tela eel- \\nlidosa ), which is often very succulent, and next to \\nit, a fleshy substance, (parenchyma). This incloses \\nthe pith, which in fact is a cellular texture of a dif- \\nferent nature, at times dry or juicy, at other times \\nconsistin<T of close and narrow cells. \\nAnimals, with the exception of some of the vermes, \\nare simple beings, but mo st plants not so ; for only some \\nannuals and palms are simple plants, the rest are all \\nof a compound structure. If we put the seeds of \\nan annual plant, 125, No. 8, «.), in the ground, \\nplants grow from it, which soon flower, produce seeds, \\nand then die. The buds of trees and shrubs are to \\nbe considered as annual plants, for as soon as they \\nhave blossomed and shed their seeds, they entirely \\ndecay. The trunks of trees and shrubs as well as \\nthe roots of perennial plants have a great many buds, \\nwhich are all of the same nature, and may be consi- \\ndered as repositories of many other annual plants. \\nThey are, therefore, not simple, butUke the polypes \\nin the animal kingdom, compound bodies. Below \\nthe bark in these plants there are, according to the \\nspecies, as we shall more particularly specify, the ru- \\ndiments of a number of buds, which by due supply \\nof sap, may be finally evolved. New-formed branch- \\n\\nPTIYSIOLOGV. \\n255 \\nes of clipped willows, are therefore not to be consi- \\ndered (J 216), a3 reproduced parts. \\n§ 233. \\nWe learn from chemical analysis that the con- \\nstituent parts of vegetables are very different \\nfrom those of animals. Carbon, hydrogen and \\noxygen are the simple substances of which plants arc \\nprincipally composed. Azote is perceptible in all \\nthe parts of animals, excepting in the fat. It is \\nfound in few plants, and that only in particular parts. \\nCarbon is the chief constituent of vesietables. It is \\nfrom this that plants in dry distillation emit so great \\na quantity of carbonic acid gas, and leave behind them \\nmany pieces of coal. \\nSulphur and piiosphorus, both of which abound \\nin animals, are but rarely observed in the vegetable \\nworld. Sulj)hur becomes perceptible in the roots of \\nthe Rumex Fatientia, after they have been rubbed \\nand immersed in water. \\nSulphur and phosphorus are both visible in plants \\nof the fifteenth class, (Tetradymania) which also con- \\ntain azote. They are found also in the seeds of \\nthe different species of grain. \\nThe seeds of Sinapis alba, and Triticum aestivuniy \\nwhen distilled, emit phosphorus, and the ashes of all \\nplants of the Tetradynamia class contain phosphate \\nof lime. \\nPotash or vegetable alkali exists in almost all \\nplants, though in very small proportions. The Fi- \\nlices, the Erigeron canadense, the fruits of the Syringa \\nn;ulgaris and Aesculus Hippocastamm are alone par- \\n\\n254 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANT, ETC. \\nticularly supplied with it. It is found most frequent- \\nly in combination with vegetable acids. \\nSoda is peculiar to marine plants. \\nLime is a residuum found in the ashes of plants, \\nand was formerly combined with vegetable acids. \\nIt is most plentiful in the Chara tomentosa, a pound \\nof which yields six ounces of carbonate of lime. In \\nthe Fungi, at least in the Peziza and Byssus, not a \\nparticle of lime can be discovered. \\nAlumina, Silica, and Magnesia are not nearly so \\ngeneral. The first occurs very seldom. Silica ex- \\nists in the ashes of most vegetables, but is found \\nchiefly in the grasses. \\nIn the Bambusa arundinacea, it produces a pecu- \\nliar concretion. It also forms a consituent part of \\nthe fibres of plants. It appears to exist in the wood \\nof the Alnus glutinosa and Betula alba, as the wood \\nwhen turned upon the lathe frequently appears to \\nglitter. ^Magnesia is much less frequent than lime. \\nSome plants, however, possess it in as great a degree. \\nThus, the Salsola Soda has in one pound nearly five \\ndrachms of pure magnesia. \\nBarytes is alleged by some to exist in the grasses. \\nIron, but still more frequently, manganese is percep- \\ntible in the ashes of almost every plant*. \\nThe following salts, compounded from neutrals, \\nare the most abundant in the vegetable kingdom. \\nSulphate and Muriate of Potash, Sulphate of Lime. \\nSulphate of Soda is not so common.

Muriate of Soda exists in \\nseveral marine plants, and is found in a crystalizcd \\nform on the leaves of a South American plant. \\nNitrate of Potash is seen in the Borrago officinalis, \\nHelianthus anmius, Mesembryanthemum crystaUinum \\nand edule, Achillea mil/efolium, Fumaria officinalis, \\nSonchus arvejisis, &c. &c. Nitrate of JMagnesia in \\nZea Mays. \\n§ 234. \\nFrom the chemical principles now pren)ised va- \\nrious substances are formed, according to the diver- \\nsity of proportion, and the particular kind of combi- \\nnation. These are called the more immediate con- \\nstituents of vegetables. The following are ail that \\nhave hitherto been discovered : \\n1. Mucilage, a tasteless, friable substance, destitute \\nof smell, and soluble in cold or warm water, to \\nwhich it communicates a viscidity. It is found in \\nalmost all plants, and in some forms the constituent \\npart; for example, in the roots of the Althaea ojtci- \\nnalis, in the stalks of the Astragalus creticus and \\ngiminifer, in the leaves of the Malva rottmd\\'ifoliaj \\nin the seeds of the Pyrus Cydo\\'nia and Plantago Cy- \\nflops, in the flowers of the Verbascum Thapsus, &c. \\nIt exudes from the bark of some trees like gum ; for \\nexample, Mimosa ftilotica, Prunus domestica and \\navium. \\n2. Sugar possesses a peculiarly sweet taste, dis- \\nsolves in cold or warm water, and in spirit of wine. \\nIt is found in a great many plants, but seldom pure, \\nas it is generally combined with Mucilage, extractive, \\nacids, or Neutrals which have an excess of acid, \\n\\n2o6 \\nrFtlNCrPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nNeutral salts, i-\\'ure sugar is obtained from Saccha- \\nrmn ojficinarum, Acer saccharinum and dasycaiyim. \\nA mixture of Honey and Manna differ very little \\nfrom sugar. \\n3. Vegetable acids consist of carbon, hydrogen, \\nand oxygen, and their diversity originates in the \\nvariable proportion of these constituents. We are \\nat present acquainted with six kinds of vegetable \\nacids, namely : \\na. Tartaric acid is found as supertartrate of pot- \\nash in the fruits of the Vitis vinifcra, Tama- \\nrindus indica, Berberis vulgans, and Rhus \\ntyphinum, in the herb of Melissa officimliSi \\nand Centaurea benedictay in the roots of the \\nOnonis, &c. \\nb. Oxalic acid, which like the former, is frequent- \\nly combined with potash, occurs as super- \\noxalate of potash in different species of the \\nOxalis and Rumex. It is found perfectly \\nneutralized in a great many barks and roots, \\nand in this state is particularly plentiful in \\nRhubarb. \\nc. Citric acid is discovered combined with a little \\nmucilage, in the fruits of Citrus medica, Vacf \\ncinium O.ri/coccus, Vitia itiaea, and Prunus \\nFadus. It is found almost equally mixed \\nwith mucilage and malic acid, in Ribes Gros^\\' \\nsularia, Rubus Idaeiis, Ribes rubrum, Vacci- \\nnium Myrtillus, Pyrus Aria^ Prunus Cera- \\nsus, Fragaria venca, Sec. \\nd. Malic acid differs from the preceding in this \\nrespect, that it never appears in a crystalized \\n\\nPIiySIOLOGY. \\nC57 \\nform. It is found as pure acid, and never \\nver combined with potash. It is contained \\nalmost pure, at least combined only with \\nsugar and mucilage, in sour apples, in the \\nfruits of the Sambucus nigra, Prunus spinosa, \\nSorbus auctiparia, and Prunus domestica. \\nThe juice of several species of Sedum, Sen> \\npervivum, Crassula, and Mesembryanthe- \\nmum, contains a great quantity of Super- \\nmalate of lime. \\nc. Benzoic acid may be sublim.ed without being \\ndestroyed. It is discovered in the resin of \\nthe Sty rax Benzoin, in the balsam of the \\nMyroxylon pendferum, and Toluifera Bal- \\nsamum, and last of all in the fruit of the \\nVanilla aromatica. \\nf. Gallic acid possesses the property of precipi- \\ntating iron black, and is found combined • \\nwith tannin in all plants of an astringent taste. \\n4. Starch does not combine with cold water, but, \\ncombines with boiling water, and forms a well-known \\npaste. It is a constituent of the different species \\nof corn, of bulbous roots, and others ; such as, \\nOrchis, Arum, Jatropha Maniliot, Solanum tubero- \\nsum, Bryonia alba and dioica, Poeonia officina- \\nlis, Sec. The pulp of some palms is pure starch, for \\nexample, the well-known Sago of Caryota zire?is. It \\nis found in the seeds of some plants, as in Aesculus \\nIlippocastanum, Amygdalus conmiunis. Lichen isim- \\ndicU\\'S, ran^iferimis, ^\\'c. and in many liverworts. \\nn \\n\\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANr, ETC. \\n5. Gluten seldom occurs in the vegetable kingdom. \\nIt does not dissolve in water of any temperature. Be- \\nfore being dried it is very viscous, tenacious, and \\nelastic; when dried, it resembles horn, and burns \\nwith precisely the same smell. Upon ihe whole, as \\nit contains azote, it approaches nearer to animal sub- \\nstances. It is separated from the flour of wheat by \\nwashing in cold water. It is found also in the \\njuices of beech and birch trees, and in the woody \\nfibres of several plants*. \\n6. Albumen dissolves only in cold water. It is \\nhardened by boiling water, and, w4ien distilled, sets \\nloose volatile alkaline salt. It is found in the fa- \\nrinaceous seeds of several plants, in those of the \\nTetradynamia class, in the juice of white cabbage^ in \\nthe root of the S cilia maritima, 8^c. \\n7. The extractive principle, when separated from \\n.other constituents with which it is combined in the \\nplants, is a solid bitter rough-tasted substance, which \\nmay be dissolved at any temperature in water \\nor spirit of wine. It discovers itself chiefly by its \\ngreat aflinity for oxygen, which it rapidly absorbs, \\nthus becoming insoluble in water. It is found in al- \\nmost every plant without exception, never pure, but \\ncombined with mucilage, sugar, resin, acids, &c. &c. \\nIn modern times only it has been properly distin- \\nguished. Formerly it was confounded with vegetable \\nmucilage, or, when by being combined with oxygen \\n* Ammoniacum or volatile alkaline salt, is, in chemical ana- \\nlysis, originally formed from azote and hydrogen in the plant, \\nand is seldom to be found on them in snch a state. \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n259 \\nit had become insoluble in water, it was considered \\nas resin. The name soapy matter, which is some- \\ntimes given to this substance, is improper, and often \\nleads to very erroneous ideas. \\n8. Tannin is a solid friable brown substance of \\nvery astringent taste, and has some resemblance to \\nthe extractive principle, but differs in this respect, \\nthat it transforms animal jelly into a viscid substance \\ninsoluble in water and proof against corruption. On \\nthis is founded a property which plants, containing \\nthis matter, possess of converting the gelatinous skin \\nof animals into insoluble leather. Tannin also preci- \\npitates in various colours the metals which have been \\ndissolved in acids. It precipitates iron, black, by \\nwhich means common ink is obtained. It is always \\nfound combined with gallic acid in the barks of \\nmany trees, in many kinds of wood and roots, in the \\nleaves of some plants, and in the excrescences occa- \\nsioned by insects. \\nIt abounds chiefly in Quercus Robur and pedun- \\ncmlata, Rhus typhinumy in the bark of Salix, Alnus? \\nFraxinus, and Cinchona, in the nut-shell of the Jug- \\nlans regia, in the roots of Tormentilla, Potentilla, \\nFragaria, Polygonum Bistorta, &c. &c. \\n9. Fixed oil is an inflammable, tasteless fluid \\nwithout smell, and is not soluble either in water or \\nin spirit of wine. Combined with caustic alkaline \\nsalt it becomes soap which is soluble in water : it is \\ndestroyed by the heat of boiling water. It consists \\nprincipally of hydrogen and carbon, and is found al- \\nmost exclusively in the seeds and fruits of vegetables ; \\nfor example, Amygdalus commimis, Linuni mtatk- \\nr2 \\n\\n25d \\nPRINCIPtKS OF BOTANr, ETC. \\nsimum, &c. &c. Cyperus esculentics is the only \\nplant hitherto discovered^ the root of which yields \\nfixed oil. \\n10. Wax is a vegetable oil condensed by oxygen? \\nand is discovered in the fruits of Laurus nobilis, \\nMyrica cerif\\'era, Tomex sebifera, and in the pollen \\nof almost all plants. It is from this that bees pre- \\npare their wax. \\n11. Resin is a brittle, solid substance, which, \\nthough insoluble in water, may be dissolved in oil \\nand spirit of wine. It is melted with slight heat, and \\nburns with the application of flame. It is found in a \\ngreat many plants, as in the Pinus, Juniperus, &c. \\ncombined with real volatile oil, it is called bal- \\nsam. Some allege that the name balsam should be \\ngiven only to such resins as contain benzoic acid. \\n12. Caoutchouc is a very elastic substance, not \\nunlike leather, and is soluble onlv in Ether. It \\nproceeds like milky juice from the trees in the torrid \\nzone, for ex. Suphonia Cahuchu, Commiphora Jlla- \\ndagascariensis, &c. It is found in the berries of \\nViscum album. It is probably a constituent of seve- \\nral gum-resins. \\n13. Gum-resins, Mucus-resins are to be con- \\nsidered not as mere mixtures of Mucus or gum and \\nresin, but as possessing a compound nature, and as \\nproperly forming the more immediate constituents of \\nvegetables. They flow like milk from several plants. \\nSome approach to the nature of oxidized extractive. \\nThey also contain resin, sugar, mucus. Caoutchouc, \\nnnd volatile oil Several species of gum used by \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n261 \\napothecaries belong to this class, for ex. Assafoetida, \\nSagapoenum Ammoniacum, Galbanum, &c. &c. \\n14. Volatile oil is an inflammable volatile liquid \\nwhich wholly dissolves in spirit of wine, and partially \\nin water. It has a remarkable taste and smell, and \\nmay be distilled over without being destroyed. It is \\nfound in a great number of plants, and may be con- \\ntained in all their parts, roots, wood, rinds, leaves, \\nflowers, fruits, principally, however, in the pulp of \\nfruits. Although volatile oils all agree with one an- \\nother in their essential qualities, they differ con- \\nsiderably in regard to colour, smell, taste, con- \\nsistence, and weight. In progress of time they con- \\ndense, and assume the appearance of resins, by be- \\ning combined with oxygen. \\n15. Camphor is a solid white-coloured substance, \\nfriable, and very inflammable. It has a peculiai\\' \\nsmell and taste, and is extremely volatile. It exists \\nchiefly in all the parts of the Laurus, Camphora, as \\nalso in many species of Laurus Cinnamonum, Ikc. \\nSome volatile oils also contain it, for ex. those of La- \\nvandula Spica, Origanum Majoranay Salvia offlcina- \\nUs, S^c. \\n15. The bitter principle is found in those plants \\nwhich in a fresh condition burn the mouth and blister \\nthe skin, but which lose this property when dried ; \\nfor ex. Scilla maritima, Arum maculalum, Ilelleborus \\nniger, Chclidonum majiis, Digitalis p^irpurca, most \\nof the species of Ranunculus, &c. &c. It is some- \\ntimes combined with volatile oils ; for ex. Cochlcaria \\nnnoi^acia, offic\\'maUs, Sinapis alba, nigra, S^c. \\nR 3 \\n\\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTAKY, ETC. \\n17. The narcotic principle, is considered as the ori- \\nginal cause of the bad effects which the fruit of several \\nplants produces on the brain, in diminishing the \\npower of sensation and motion, and, when taken in \\nlarge doses, by inducing sleep, and in the end occa- \\nsioning vertigo, stupefaction, and even death. To \\nthis description belong Papaver somniferum, Hyoscy- \\namus mge7\\\\ Datura Stj^amonium^ Prunus Lauroce- \\nrasiiSj Atropa Belladonna *, S^c. \\n18. Fibrin must necessarily be considered as a \\nproper constituent of vegetables, as its chemical \\nprocess in plants is different from what it is in all \\nother bodies. It is quite insoluble, has neither taste \\nnor smell, and, beside the three necessary elements, \\nalso contains azote f. \\nJ 235. \\nAs the life of animals depends on external warmth, \\nso likewise plants need a certain degree of it. Plants \\nof warm countries require more of it than those \\nwhich belong to cold ones. These are facts which \\n* These two last substances haue not yet been sufficiently \\ninvestigated and ascertained. \\n+ Some rank a particular colouring principle among vege- \\ntable substances ; but the property which some plants pos- \\nsess of communicating a certain colour to matter, is common \\nto several constituents of vegetables. It is often pure extrac- \\ntive, but more frequently combined with oxygen, sometimes \\ntoo the colouring constituents are of a resinous nature. Seve- \\nral well-known colours, as Indigo, woad, litmus, &c. are not \\nconstituents of the vegetables from which they are procured, \\n^ut in reality productions of art. \\n\\nPHYSJOLOGY. \\n^63 \\nneed no further demonstration. But whether plant?, \\nlike animals, have a fixed and peculiar degree of \\nheat, is a question which must now he answered. \\nWe find that trees or shrubs, in cold climates, if they \\ngrow wild, endure the greatest cold without harm. \\nAs soon as the warmth of spring commences, they \\nevolve their buds, and apparently suffer no bad \\neffects from the cold, though their stem and branches \\nare full of moisture. If in a strong frost we put \\nvessels with water close to such a tree, we shall find \\nthat the water is converted into ice, but that the tree \\nretains its sap unfrozen, and remains quite unhurt. \\nThe case is different in plants of warm and hot \\nregions. The sap of these plants congeals at the \\nleast degree of cold, and the plants decay. Thus \\nthere appears a remarkable difference between the \\nplants of cold and those of hot climates. As long as \\nplants live and possess sufficient vital power to resist \\ncold, their sa[) will not congeal. But after the buds \\nhave been forced out by the warm weather of spring, \\nthey will, when exposed to cold evenings, be observed \\nto congeal. We find, likewise, that dead or diseased \\nbranches are more liable to be frost-bitten than living \\nand sound ones, and that branches, by their sap be- \\ning congealed, are destroyed. The birch and some \\nother plants, it is well known, often have their roots \\ncovered with ice, without suffering the least injury. \\nIn the northern hemisphere of our globe there are \\nmany and extensive tracts of pine trees, which resist \\nwith their evergreen branches the most severe winter \\ncold. From those observations it follows, that each \\nplant, according to its species, possesses a peculiar \\nR 4 \\n\\n264 \\nPRINCIPLES 01- BOTANY, ETC. \\ndegree of warmth, which defends it against the incle- \\nmency of the Aveather. \\nBat this heat in vegetables is not of such a nature \\nas to enable us to judge of its peculiar degree by our \\nsenses. We know that every animal has a certain \\ndegree of heat. We find a frog or lizard cold, al- \\nts & \\' \\nthough nature has given them a certain degree of \\nheat. The temperature of [)lants is such as to enable \\nthem to resist both lieat and cold. If, in a hot sum- \\nmer day, we touch some ground which is much ex- \\nposed to the rays of the sun, and immediately after \\nput our hand on green grass, equally exposed to \\nthem, we shall find the ground much hotter than \\nthe grass. Fruits, though much in the sun, will be \\ncool, whereas a glass full of water will be quite warm \\nin a much shorter time. \\nSonnerat discovered in the island of Lueon a ri- \\nvulet, the water of which was so hot, that a thermo- \\nmeter immersed in it, rose to 174° Fahrenh. Swal- \\nlows when flying seven feet high over it, dropped \\ndown motionless. Notwithstanding this heat he \\nobserved on its banks two species of Aspalathus and \\nthe Vitex Agnus castus, which with their roots swept \\nthe water. In the island of Tanna, Messrs. Forsters \\nfound the ground near a volcano as hot as 210° \\nFahrenheit, and at the same time covered with \\n■flowers. \\nIlence it naturally follows, that plants, like ani- \\nmals, have a peculiar temperature, according to their \\nnative countries, Avhich they cannot exceed without \\ninjury^ The experiments of Mr J. Hunter and \\nSchoepf shew us the same thing. The first put a \\n\\nPHVSlOLOCr. \\nScotch fir, three years old, in a freezing mixture of be- \\ntween 15° and 17° Fahrenheit. The youngest shoot \\nfroze ; the fir was again planted, the young shoot re- \\nmained flaccid, but the first and second were fresh. \\nOf young plants of oats, which had only three leaves, \\none leaf was exposed to artificial cold at SB*\\', and \\nwas instantly frozen. The root was put into the same \\ncold mixture, but remained uninjured. He then \\nplanted it, and all its parts grew, except the leaf, \\n■which had been frozen. The same experiment he \\nrepeated in a young bean ; a leaf of it was frozen \\nin an artificial freezing mixture, and another fresh \\nleaf was bent in the middle upon itself, put into a \\nleaden vessel, and along with it the frozen leaf, which \\nhad been previously thawed. lie afterwards put the \\nvessel into a freezino; mixture. The surface of the \\nfresh leaf froze as far as it came in contact with the \\nvessel between 15 and 17°, the atmosphere being \\nat 22°. The frozen leaf froze much sooner. .These \\nexperiments were repeated, and attended with the \\nsame result- The juice of spinnage and cabbage, \\nwhen squeezed out, congealed at 29°, and thawed \\nagain between 29 — 30°. This juice was frozen in a \\nleaden vessel and then put into another, with a cold \\nmixture at 28^. The leaves of a growing fir-shoot, \\nand a bean-leaf were put upon the frozen liquid which \\nin that place thawed in a few minutes. The leaves \\nhad the same effect when removed to other frozen \\nspotf. \\nSchocpf made the following experiments in North \\nAmerica. He bored holes in different stems, which \\nhe again closed up. In one of the holes he put a \\n\\n2(56 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nthermometer in cold weather, in order to compare \\nthe internal heat with that of the atmosphere. The \\nresult, however, differed at different times, and in \\nproportion to the different thickness of the stem. \\nHe made some other experiments by means of a \\nthermometer, comparing the temperature of the at- \\nmosphere with that of the leaves. The above rela- \\nted experiments of Mr Hunter plainly shew, that \\nthe juices of plants have a peculiar temperature of \\ntheir own. But those of Schoepf cannot, as he him- \\nself acknowledges, serve as decisive proofs, because \\nthe ligneous stems of plants possess a less degree of \\nvital power, and the inner bark only (as will after- \\nwards be demonstrated, § 297), is in every tree or \\nshrub the seat of this power. The power of con- \\nducting caloric, which certainly in wood is not so \\nstrong as in other bodies, alone, produces a change \\nof temperature, and renders the experiments of Mr \\nSchoepf very uncertain *. \\n§ 236. \\nThe anatomical investigation of vegetables ex- \\nplains the nature of their internal parts. The fol- \\n* Grass, roots, and the pine tribe, and all plants in general \\nwhich hare a more tenacious sap, can resist cold better than \\nothers. But trees which lose their leaves, are, as long as the \\nleaves remain, very susceptible of its impression. The reason \\nseems to be, that all sap, as long as the stem has its leaves, \\ncirculates very quicldy, and being thinner, is more liable to \\nsuffer by cold. We find, in early winters, that those trees \\nTrhich lose their leaves, sustain no injury. \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n267 \\nlowing organs have been discovered in them ; air- \\nvessels (vasa pfieumatophoraj, adducent vessels (va- \\nsa adducentia reducent vessels, ( vasa reducentia J, \\nlymphatic vessels, (vasa lymphatica), cellular tex- \\nture, fco?tte.vtus cellulosusjy vegetable fibre fjibra \\nvegetabilisj and glands, glandulae. \\nThese parts are visible only through magnifying \\nglasses, either by subjecting them to maceration, or \\nby putting them in newly cut pieces under a micro- \\nscope. Some , of them, particularly the adducent \\nvessels, may be filled with a strong coloured liquid, \\nby which means they are so much the more easily- \\nobserved. This, however, is the case only with a \\nfew. The injection of vessels with a coloured li- \\nquid is accomplished by putting the stalk of a plant \\ninto a decoction of brasil wood, and placing it in a \\nwarm temperature. Injections of this kind do not \\nsucceed with all plants, but are particularly suitable \\nto the Impatiens Balsamina. \\nI 237. \\nThe air-vessels (vasa pmumatophora), are thin, \\nhollow, corrugated vessels, smooth within, and run- \\ning perpendicularly through the plants. They are \\nconductors of air, and never change their diameter, \\nbut uniformly remain open even in the hardest wood. \\nHow they are connected with the pores of the epi- \\ndermis, has not yet been discovered by any obser- \\nvations. \\n\\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\n} 238.. \\nThe adducent vessels, ( vasa adcluccntia), are si- \\ntuated close to the ah\\' vessels, and have a double \\ndirection. They either proceed in a straight line \\nwith the air vessels, or they twine around them in \\nwide or narrow interstices, but they are often invol- \\nved in spiral windings, so close that no interstice \\ncan be perceived. When they have this twisted ap- \\npearance, they are called spiral vessels, ( msa spira- \\nlia, piieumato-chymifera, jistulae spiraks ). In plants \\nwe discover twisted vessels of greater or less ex- \\ntent, as well as those which run straight out in lines. \\nThere are also vegetables in which they are never \\ntwisted, but uniformly proceed in straight lines, for \\nexample, Sagittaria5<707V^i/b//«, and all the Filices. \\nIt is a singular circumstance, that in the Filices, \\nbundles of these last mentioned vessels are surround- \\ned with a peculiar sort of membrane which is quite \\nabstracted from the cellular texture, a section of \\nwhich shows it to be more or less circular, lunated, \\nor of a different form. \\nThese vessels are much more delicate than air ves- \\nsels in their diameter, and even do not retain the \\nsame figure. They visibly grow larger, become rough, \\nand when beginning to harden, have their interior \\ncovered with contiguous fibres ; in the end they are \\nalmost completely obstructed. \\n\\\\ 239. \\nReducent vessels ( xasa rediicentia), descend be- \\ntween the cellular texture, and are variouslv accu- \\n\\n\" PHYSIOLOGY. €>^g \\nmulated. Sometimes they take a horizontal direc- \\ntion. Hedwig supposes them to be intended for the \\npurpose of transpiration. They arc more delicate \\nthan the adducent vessels. \\n§ 240. \\nLymphatic vessels (vasa fymjjhalica ), are found \\nupon the epidermis {§ C32). They are extremely \\ndelicate, run sing]}\\', and are reticularly united. The \\ncircle or quadrate which is described on these ves- \\nsels, has usually in its centre an aperture, which, \\nhowever, has no connexion with the vessels, as will \\nbe shown in the sequel. The reticular form varies \\ngreatly in vegetables. It is constantly found in eve- \\nry species, and in a few, is subject to some altera- \\ntions. Thus, for example, in the Lilium chalcedoni\\' \\nam, these vessels run in an undulating manner, and \\ndescribe very irregular oblong figures or even rhom- \\nbi, (fig. 279 ;) in the Allium Cepa they do not undu- \\nlate, but proceed in an oblique direction parallel to \\none another by short continuations of the sides (fig. \\n280), in the Dianthus Caryophyllus they describe \\nparallelograms which terminate pretty regularly. \\nThis reticular texture covers all the parts of \\nplants, only the apertures which it surrounds are not \\nalways obvious. On the root, on the surface of the \\nleaves, on the interior side of the valves of the ca- \\nlyx, es|>ecialiy when they are coloured, on the inte- \\nrior of the petals, on the nectaria, in stamina and \\npistils no pores can be discovered, and only the ci- \\ncatrice has them sometimes. That this kind of net \\non the cortex of vegetables is not occasioned by the \\n\\n270 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\npressure of the cellular texture, but consists of real \\nvessels, appears to be beyond all doubt. \\n§ 241. \\nThe cellular texture f contextus cdlidosus, tela eel- \\nlidosa s. utriculi)y is a very delicate membrane, di- \\nvided into an infinite number of variously formed \\nsmall spaces, which are closely connected with one \\nanother. It surrounds the vessels, and occupies the \\ninternal as well as the external interstices, covers \\nboth surfaces of leaves, and is most plentiful in the \\njuicy plants and fruits. When the cellular texture is \\nvery dense and succulent, it is called, especially in \\nflesh (parenchyma^ s. pars carnosa, ^ 232 J. The \\npith of vegetables (232), is a more dense cellular \\ntexture, distinguished by its bright white colour, by \\nits finer and more compressed cells, and by its spun- \\ngy appearance. \\nThe juices conveyed in the cellular texture vary \\naccording to the different species. They are, \\nResinous, in many species of fir, &c. \\nGummy, in fruit-trees and some species of Mi- \\nmosa. \\nLymphatic, in almost all plants. \\nThe colour of the juices found in the cellular tex- \\nture, is also very multifarious. \\nThe sap likewise varies in colour : It is \\nWhite, in Euphorbia, Papaver, Leontodon, Pi- \\nnus, &c. \\nYellow, in Chelidonium. \\nlied, in Rumex sanguineus, Dracaena Draco, \\nPterocarpus sa?italmiis, Calamus Rotang, \\n2 \\n\\nrHYSIOLOGY \\n271 \\nBiue, in the root of Pimpinella ?iigra. \\nGreen, in some umbellatae. \\nColourless in most plants. \\nThe juices in fruiis are known to be of all colours. \\nRafn discovered a great analogy between the sap \\nof plants and the blood of animals. He detected, \\nwith a microscope magnifying 135 times, in the \\nlymph of Euphorbia jmlustris, round globules, like \\nthose in blood, swimming in a fluid somewhat more \\nclear, but not so clear as water. Fontana observed \\nthe same in the sap of the Rhus toxicodendron. \\nRafn, liowever, found in the Euphorbia, besides the \\nglobules, prisms, which appear in Euphorbia \\nhelioscopia, esula, cyparissias, and lathyris, though \\nsomewhat difterent. In no plant but the Euphorbia \\nand Ilura crepitans could he detect the prisms. One \\ndrop of l^niph of Euphorbia canarietisisy Caput Me- \\ndusae, Chara neriifoUa had one or two prisms at \\nmost. Alcohol congealed the juice of the Euphorbia \\nand formed a great deal of fibrous matter, \\'\\'i\\'^itriol \\nalso converted it into fibres, which however were not \\nso thick. The sap of Chelidonium consisted of no- \\nthing but closely cohering globules. In the colour- \\nless vegetable juices, even in them which are seem- \\ningly moist, the same globules appeared. A proof \\nthat the sap of some vegetables, for instance, the \\nPotenlilla anserina, is not, as Plenk supposes, merely \\nimpure or unfinished water. Rafn found in those \\nplants which have much cellular texture, e. g. the \\nMusa paradisiaca, Strelitzia Regina, the globules \\nsmaller and less frequent than in the species of \\nEuphorbia. \\n\\n272 \\nPUINCIl\\'LES OF BOTANr, ETC. \\nThe apertures which arc discovered between the \\nlymphatic vessels (§ .240) on the epidermis of plants \\nare connected with the cellular texture, and by the \\noperation of the rays of light may be opened and \\nshut, and, according to Hedwig, are designed for \\ntranspiration. Secondary vessels, ( tasa secundaria), \\nwhich Schrank has amply described, are hairy or \\nbristly formed \\'elongations of the epidermis, of a \\ncomplicated nature, hollow within, and are connected \\ntoo with the cellular texture. Some suppose that \\nthat they are created for the purpose of suction *. \\nJ 242. \\nThe vegetable fibre, (Jibra \\'cegetahilis), is a thin \\nfiliform body, found in bundles, and has apparently \\nno cavity within; it is encircled with the cellular \\ntexture, which forms around it a particular kind \\nof sheath. That this single fibre of vegetables may \\nconsist of several, will not be disputed ; but to re - \\nsolve it into its individual parts, and to demonstrate \\nthe most simple fibre,wiU probably continue to baffle \\nour researches. \\nRafn is much inclined to consider the vegetable \\nfibre as a particular and original organ, similar to \\nthe muscular fibre of animals. Hedwig, on the con- \\ntrary, supposes it to be an obsolete constipated \\nvessel. A great deal might be advanced in favour \\nof this last opinion ; for, as plants annually form \\n* Soft down, (pappus)^ and the fleecy covering of scTcral \\n3oeds, appear to be only protracted secondary Tesselb. \\n4 \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n273 \\nnew vessels, the number of fibres appears to be en- \\ncreased by the old vessels. Notwithstanding, how- \\never, it is alleged, by others, that fibres, at their \\nvery origin have been found constipated between the \\nleaves of herbs. \\nBut, even, should future obscrx\\'ations lead us to \\nregard this fibre as a constipated vessel, still it ap- \\npears certain that the skin of the vessels themselves \\nis of a muscular nature, as it is capable of contract- \\ning and expanding in a regular manner. \\n§ 243. \\nGlands (glandulae) are in vegetables of multi- \\nfarious situation and figure. Though their internal \\nstructure continues, upon the whole, pretty equal, \\nthey have not the most distant resemblance to ani- \\nmal glands, and their having the same designation is \\nentirely owing to their being more or less roundish ele- \\nvated bodies. They are found internally and external- \\nly according to their situation. Internally, they are \\nsituated in the cellular texture, or fleshy part of ve- \\ngetables, and are found, of a globular, somewhat \\noblong and lenticular figure, in the middle or the \\npartitions of the cells, as also in the inner bark. \\nExternally, they are discovered in all parts of ve- \\ngetables, either half sunk in the cuticle, rising to the \\nsurface or possessed of stalks. They have then a \\nvhry extensive variety of shape, sometimes they are \\nperpendicular, oblong, or depressed, sometimes \\nvery elevated and pointed, having their upper part \\nfurnished with a small hole, or even surrounded \\nwith an elevated margin. The different species of \\ns \\n\\n574 \\nPRINCIPLES 01 BOTANY, ETC \\nglands are exceedingly numerous, and may be dis- \\ntinguished by calculating all the varieties. Being \\nsometimes more, sometimes less obvious, they are \\nin the Hypericum yerjoratum considered merely \\ncontrary transparent particles, which are visible when \\nexposed to the rays of light. In the Hypericum \\nmontanum they are easily observable by their brown \\ncolour, and in the genera Passiflora, Mimosa and \\nCroion, their magnitude is sometimes so very con- \\nsiderable, that the mere touch of them serves to \\nconvince us of their existence. \\nGlands consist, internally, of a dense cellular \\ntexture which is too dense in proportion to the middle. \\nImmediately under their skin, and upon the vertex, \\nthey contain a matter more or less coloured, odori- \\nferous or insipid, according to the variety of the \\nplants. The glands, which are situated in the* in- \\nterior of the plants, have no connection with the \\nvessels, but glands, which are evidently situated \\non the outside of vegetables, have spiral vessels \\nl)ressing forward to their centre, and then returning \\nin a retrograde direction. \\n^ 244. \\nThe anastomosis of vessels in the vegetable king- \\ndom is totally different from what it is in animals. \\nThe adducent, reducent, and air vessels uniformly \\nrun in bundles through the vegetable body more or \\nless perpendicularly ; these separate into smaller \\nbundles, which unite with the nearest body, and \\nout of these still smaller ones adhere to a greater \\nbody ; so that, upon the whole, by the separation \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n273 \\nand union of the bundles, a reticular appearance is \\nproduced. Lympiiatic vessels, however, run singly, \\nand anastomose like the vessels of animals, their \\nboughs really uniting with the others branches. \\n§ 245. \\nAfter these general discoveries made by physiolo- \\ngists in the vegetable kingdom, it will be proper re- \\ngularly to examine the most remarkable phenomena \\nwhich have been observed in vegetables from their \\norigin out of seeds to their decay, and briefly to \\ncomprehend the inferences which hitherto have been \\ndrawn, that the recurring scenes of life and death in \\nall their various forms may thus be morefuUy elucidated. \\n§ 246. \\nThe structure of the seed has already 11 6), \\nbeen explained, and we know that it serves the same \\npurpose as the egg of animals, i. e. it contains the \\nrudiments of a new being perfectly similar to its pa- \\nrents, and waiting only for a favourable opportunity \\nof being evolved. All plants are propagated by \\nseeds, and we may boldly exclaim with Harvey \\nomne \\'civum ex ox:o. It cannot indeed be denied, that \\nthey have not been found in all plants, but their \\nexistence in Mosses, Liverworts, Mushrooms, and \\nmany others, where formerly it was obstinately dis- \\nputed, has, by the unwearied diligence of philoso- \\nphers, now been completely ascertained ; and wc \\nhave no doubt that they will one day be observed \\nin those where at present they are merely supposed \\nto exist. Agreeably to the eternal, and immutable \\nlaws of nature, we observe, just as in the animal \\nSo \\n1^ \\n\\nB76 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nworld, the same species arising always from the \\nseed, and no other vegetable can ever issue from it, \\nhow different soever may be the circumstances of its \\ntermination. \\nThe sketch of the shoot is narrowly circumscribed \\nby nature, and nothing is capable of producing an \\nalteration in its parts. The same form will be re- \\ntained, and propagated for ever. \\nA seed has integuments, corcle, and cotyledons, \\n{§ 116). It is fastened, as mentioned in the place \\nreferred to, by an umbilical cord ; and as soon as \\nthis separates, a cicatrice remains called the eye, \\n(kilum). In its vicinity lies the corcle. In the \\nhardest seeds this last spot is the only one not cover- \\ned by the internal hard membrane. \\n\\\\^ hen the seed is placed in the ground, moisture \\nsoon pervades its substance through this aperture, \\nassisted by the warmth of the atmosphere. In the \\ncorcle and cotyledons, all the described vessels are \\npresent. In the last, the adducent and air vessels \\ndivide themselves into numerous bundles, which fre- \\nquently anastomose in the manner peculiar to the \\nplant, (§ 244)- A cellular membrane covers on \\nboth sides those vessels which spread on one plain \\nsurface, and contains the reducent vessels. On \\nboth surfaces the lymphatics spread out and surround \\nthe apertures of the cuticle. The pervading mois- \\nture is communicated to the vessels ; the water is \\ndecomposed by them, and hydrogen and oxygen \\ntranspired. Carbonic acid gas, which seems to be \\nshut up in the neighbourhood of the umbilicus be- \\ntween the external and internal membranes of the \\n\\nPHYSrOLOGV. \\n277 \\nseed is likewise partly set free. The intercepted air \\nwhich was received from germinating seeds, contain- \\ned in 10 cubic inches, sometimes 2, sometimes 3, \\n5, even 8 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas ; and \\nfrom 5 and 6 to 8 cubic inches of azote and hydro- \\ngen gas mixed. This gas, when mixed with atmos- \\npheric air, explodes at the approach of flame. The \\nrest of the undecomposed water, with the fixed \\npart of carbon and hydrogen, pervades the vessels \\nmore and more, reduces the substance of the seed \\nto a milk-white fluid, occassions a stimulus, and \\nby the irritability of the vessels, excites the action \\nof the vital power. The vessels, filled with their \\nsap, carry it to the corcle, which is elongated by \\nit, and converted into a plant. \\nThe corcle consists, we know, {§ 11 5), of the \\nrostel, (rostellum), and the plumule, (plumula). \\nFrom the first arises the root, from the last the \\ntrunk, or the part above ground. Cutting a germi- \\nnating plant in a perpendicular direction, so as to \\ndivide it into equal parts, we observe in the middle \\nof each cotyledon a hollow channel which is called \\nthe chyliferous duct, ( Ductus chyliferus), which is \\ncontinued as far as the beginning of the rostel, pro- \\nceeds between its pith and fleshy substance, and at \\nlast incloses the pith. This duct serves to convey \\nthe nourishing fluid, which the cotyledons contain, \\nto the young plant. Experience teaches us, that \\ngerminating plants, even though they have some \\nleaves already evolved, cannot.part with their coty- \\nledons without endangering their liveS; like a young \\ns 3 \\n\\n378 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nanimal which cannot want the feeding breast of its \\nmother *. \\n§ 247. \\nIt is a remarkable phenomenon in the germina- \\ntion of seeds, that the radicle first elongates, and \\npushes into the earth, where as soon as it fixes itself, \\nthe plumule appears in its peculiar shape, {§ ^49). \\nEven though the seed should be inverted and put \\ninto the ground, so as to turn the rostel towards the \\nsurface, yet it never will grow upwards. It grows \\nlong, but soon turns the seed, and goes into the \\nground, so that it recovers its proper position. This \\nobservation, which may be made every day, espe- \\ncially in the kidney bean, (Phaseolus vulgaris); \\nin the common bean, (Vic\\'ia. Faba J, and other culi- \\nnary seeds, has greatly attracted the attention of bo- \\ntanists. Dr Percival explains this by instinct, and \\nendeavours to prove thence that plants have sensation \\nand consciousness. Hedwig offers two reasons by \\nwhich this tendency of the rostel dov^nwards may be \\nexplained : In the first place, the sap is, by the two \\n* According to my own experience, the rostel dries up en- \\ntirely, if immediately after the seed begins to germinate, we \\ncut oft\" both cotyledons, and all vegetation ceases. Fabroni, \\nhowever, says, that a young plant may lose half of its cotyle- \\ndons without any bid efl\\'ects, and he even has cut off tlm \\nwhole, and the vegetation went on. But probably this ex- \\nperiment was made on plants where the plumule was already \\nsomewhat large. Hedwig observes, that the plumule may bf \\ncut ofi\\', and that in its place two young shoots will appaar \\ni doubt Tcry much if this be the case with all plants. \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n279 \\nchylilerous ducts accumulated in the extremity of the \\nrostel, which therefore becomes heavier, and accord- \\ning to the laws of gravity, is drawn downwards. Ir; \\nthe second place, the moisture in the extremity of the \\nrostel, is attracted by that of the ground. But both \\nthese reasons appear to me to be insufficient to ex- \\nplain this phenomenon ; for first, the power of gra- \\nTity and attraction is one and the same power ; and \\nsecondly, the cotyledons contain by far more mois- \\nture, and possess a greater absolute gravity; but \\nnotwithstanding this are often by the rostel pushed \\nabove ground. We are in fact as little capable of \\naccounting for this phenomenon, as of giving the \\nprecise reason why several caterpillars spin a case, \\nwhile others bury themselves in the ground. We \\nare ignorant of the nature of this as of many other \\noperations in organized bodies. The only way of \\nhiding our ignorance is, to consider it as an action \\nof the vital power. Dr Percival\\'s assertion is a \\nvery precipitate conclusion, which deserves no at- \\ntention. \\n§ 248. \\nIt is to be observed, that seeds are not all provid- \\ned with the rostel, especially those of some aquatic \\nand parasitic plants, and perhaps all those which \\nDr Gaertner styles acotyledones. I was, as far as I \\nknow, the first who discovered this, by examining \\nwith great care the water-caltrops, (\\'Trapa natans), \\none of the most singular plants. The nuts, as they \\nare called, of this plant, when they He in water, the \\nnatural habitation of the plant, shoot forth a long \\ns 4 \\n\\nPIllNCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC \\nplumule, which in a perpendicular direction rises \\ntowards the surface of the water, its sides pushing \\nout at certain distances, capillary, branched leaves. \\nSonic of those leaves bend downwards and take firm \\nroot at the bottom. In this case then the plant be- \\ncomes fixed in the ground, not by a peculiar root, \\nwhich like the rostel, pre-existed in the seed, but \\nonly through the leaves. It would be as difficult as \\nin the rostel, to state the reason, why some of the \\nundermost leaves bend downwards, and by their ca- \\npillary extremities shoot forth roots. \\nFrom this, however, we are enabled to conclude, \\nthat some seeds may support the want of the rostel ; \\nbut that, a germinating seed can exist without plu- \\nmule and cotyledons, is a supposition altogether in- \\nadmissible. Nobody as yet has attempted to deny \\nthe existence of the plumule in any seed. Linn^, \\nGaertner, Jussieu, and many other botanists, de- \\nnied tiiat, of the cotyledons, especially in the plants \\nbielonging to the class Cryptogamia, 142). Jussieu \\nalone adds to those plants which have no cotyledon, \\nGaertner\\'s acotyledones, such as want the rostel. \\nNature has provided plants with their cotyledons, \\nlhat these might nourish the young plant in its tender \\ninfancy. Never yet have I met with a single in- \\nstance where this wise measure of nature was omit- \\nted. I examined purposely all those plants which \\nwere said to want the cotyledons, and always found \\nthem. That in some plants the existence of tlie \\ncotyledons was altogether denied, and others were \\nsaid to have one only, others two, and several plants \\nmore than two, arose partly fiom inaccurate ob- \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n281 \\nservation, partly from mistaking a part of the plu- \\nmula for a cotyledon. Placenta or cotyledon, 1 16), \\nis the name of the whole substance of a seed, not \\nincluding the parts of the coicle. It rises in many \\nplants with the plumule above ground, and is con- \\nverted into leaves ; or, it remains in the ground, and, \\nas in the gramina and lilies, the first leaf of tlie plu- \\nmule only rises, and this is what some thought to \\nbe a cotyledon. In flax and the species of fir, \\nboth cotyledons are converted into leaves, and the \\nleaves of the plumula are evolved immediately after \\nthem, and are of the same magnitude and appearance. \\nHence it was, that botanists supposed there were \\nmany cotyledons. The division, therefore, of plants \\nin acotyledones, monocotyledones, dicotyledones and \\npolycotyledones, is erroneous. \\n§ 249. \\nI am acquainted only with three varieties, which \\nare discovered in the cotyledons of the germinating \\nseed. The cotyledons are either split into two parts, \\nor they adhere so firmly to one another, that they \\ncannot be separated. In the first case, they grow \\nout of the earth, till they become visible, and as- \\nsume the appearance of leaves : these are denomi- \\nnated by botanists dicotyledones, and the same pro^ \\ncess takes place in the most of plants. As a very \\ncommon example, I may adduce the kidney bean, \\nPhaseolus vulgaris : In the second case, they remain \\nin the ground, and only the plumule grows up, as in \\nin the vetch, Vicia Sativa, in the pea Pisum sati- \\nz:iimy in all the gramina, lilia, &c. In the third case, \\n\\n282 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nthe cotyledons, or the two halves of the seed, ar6 \\nnot divided, but pushed upon the ground, and on \\ntheir side the plumule is evolved, as in Juncus, \\n&c. &c. I have not been able to perceive any more \\nvarieties {§ 1 l6), and every one may easily sa- \\ntisfy himself of the truth of what I have mentioned. \\nI have observed, according to the changes in the \\ncotyledons, five principal varieties, which I call \\nmembranous corcles, (deimoblastae) ; filiform cor- \\ncles, (mmoblastae) ; split corcles, (phveoblastae) ; \\nearth corcles, (gcoblastae) ; and globular corcles, \\n(spheroblastae), \\n\\\\ 250. \\nDermoblaslae, I call such as have the cotyledon \\nin form of a membrane, which bursts in an irregu- \\nlar manner. This membrane is found in the Fungi, \\nwhere, in general, it disappears immediately after \\ntheir evolution. \\nWe would require still further observations on \\nthis point, especially in the small Fungi, and even \\nin these, different modifications may possibly ap- \\npear ; but this is merely a supposition about which \\nnothing certain is known. Most of the plants \\nwhich have this peculiarity are so very small, that \\ntheir existence and characteristic varieties can be \\nperceived with difficulty, much less is an accu- \\nrate knowledge of such very minute plants to be \\nexpected. \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY, \\n283 \\n§ 251. \\nNemoblastae, These appear in Mosses and Fi- \\nlices, and may perhaps be found also in Algae. To \\nprove their existence in the last, however, we still \\nneed more accurate observations. The substance \\nof the cotyledon in them divides into two halves, \\nand bursts into an irregular shape, resembling \\nthreads*. \\n^ 252. \\nPlexeoblastae, are those in which the cotyledons \\nappear above ground in two parts, and change into \\nleaves, which are of a different shape from the rest \\nof the leaves. They are elliptic in the species of \\' \\nPhaseolus; linear in the umbellatae, and in the \\nPlantago; cordate in the plants of the sixteenth \\nclass of Linnaeus ; inversely cordate in those of the \\n15th class ; reniform in the ringent plants ; wedge- \\nshaped, and at the point variously intersected, in \\nthe lime treef, &c. \\n* Some young species of Manna germinate in this manner. \\nIt appears to me that in the genus Lichen, the plumule ex. \\npands into a flat lobe, but that the cotyledons grow up, and \\nare not separated. In such circumstances it would belong to the \\nGeoblastae. \\nf The Filices, which I have often seen germinate, belong \\nto this division, only with the following difference. The two \\ncotyledons either separate and become two leaves, or they se- \\nparate only in part, remaining connected together below, ani \\nare changed into an infundibuliform ^8af^ \\n\\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANV, ETC- \\n§ 253. \\nGcohlastaf., are those which keep the substance \\nof the cotyledons under ground, e. g. the vetch, pea, \\nthe gramina, lilies, &c. They arc of a double kind. \\nRhizoblastas, uherc the seed has a rostel, and \\nshoots down a straight root, as in most plants be- \\nlonging to this class. \\nArhizoblastae, when the seed wants the rostel , \\nas in some aquatic and parasitic plants *. \\n§ 254. \\nSjjhaerohlastae, are those whose cotyledons are \\nnot disunited, but which come out of the ground in \\nform of little globules fixed upon a small stalk, and \\nhave the plumula on their side. Tiiis we meet with \\nin Juncus Bnfonius subverticillatus, and some plants \\nrelated to it. Several botanists who were unac- \\nquainted with this singular mode of germination, \\nhave mistaken the above-mentioned plant for a new \\none belonging to the 24th class of Linnaeus. \\nJ 255. \\nIt has long been known, that every plant affect):\\' \\nits own peculiar soil, and that on this account^ \\nseeds do not germinate in all kinds of soil, at \\nleast they soon decay in a disadvantageous one. \\nVarious trials have been made, to make seeds ger- \\n* I have obberTcd Riccia cristallma, Marchantia pol^mor- \\npha shoot from seedsj and can safely affirm that they belong \\nto this division. \\n\\nrUYSIOLOGY, \\n285 \\nininate in various matters, different from the usual \\nearths.

In oil, on the \\ncontrary, carbon, hydrogen, in the filings of lead, \\niron, and copper, as well as in powdered molybdene \\nand in alkalis, no one seed germinated. It soon oc- \\ncurred to him, that with oxygen as a stimulant he \\nmight forcibly make seeds germinate faster, and he \\nactually found, that at the temperature of fiO\" Reaum. \\nall seeds vegetated most rapidly when steeped in \\noxy-muriatic acid. One instance alone will suflfice. \\nThe seeds of the Lepidium sativum germinated after \\n6 or 7 hours, when put into oxy-muriatic acid ; where- \\nas, when lying in common w ater, they required from \\n36 to 38 hours. In a letter dated February, 1801, \\nlie writes to me, that in Vienna they derived much \\nbenefit from the discovery of this fact, and that seeds \\ntwenty and thirty years old, brought from the Ba- \\nhama islands, Madagascar, &:c. wliich constantly \\nrefused to gerniinate, very readily, in this way, ve- \\n\\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC \\ngetated, and produced plants M\\'hich grew up very \\nsuccessfully. The Mimosa scandens, which as yet is \\nnot to be found in any botanic garden, grew very \\nwell uith this acid. As every gardener cannot ob- \\ntain the oxy-muriatic acid, Mr Humboldt proposes a \\nvery easy method to procure it without difficulty. \\nHe took a cubic inch of water, a tea-spoonful of \\ncommon muriatic acid, two tea spoontuis of oxyd of \\nmanganese, mixed it and placed the seeds in them. \\nThe whole was now allowed to digest with a heat of \\n18 — 30° Reaum. In this the seeds germinate ex» \\ncellenily ; but it is necessary to take the seeds out, \\nas soon as the corcle appears. That the seeds are \\nnot injured by the acid, is proved by the many \\nplants which have been treated in this way, imder \\nthe inspection of Mr Jacquin, and in which vegeta- \\ntion went on extremely well. \\nIt is the oxygen of the atmosphere which stimu- \\nlates the seed to germination. And this explains at \\nonce the experiment of Mr Achard, why plants ve- \\ngetate faster in very compressed air, than in air in \\nits common state. \\nBesides oxygen, ammonia too favours the ger- \\nmination of seeds ; hence they germinate almost \\nimmediately when placed in dung, which therefore \\nserves as manure. Cow-dung, we know, consists \\nof muriatic acid and ammonia. In fluids which con- \\ntain no oxygen, seeds will not germinate. Thus they \\nnever germinate in oil, which consists of hydrogen \\nand carbon. \\n\\nVHrsIOLOGV. \\n287 \\nIt is the rostel of seeds which produces the part \\nof a plant under ground, and which is called the \\ndescending stem or root, {§ 10). But physiologists \\ncall that part only a root, which carries nourishment \\nfrom the soil to the plant, or what we before called \\nradicles or fibres, (radicnlaj. \\nIn under shrubs thi9 stem descending under \\nground consists of a bulbous, tuberous, fibrous or \\noblong root. In annual plants it is more or less per- \\npendicular; and in shrubs and trees its formation \\nentirel}^ resembles the stem. In this, foresters again \\ndistinguish two separate parts, the thick one, which \\ndescends perpendicularl3% called the main root ; and \\nthose parts which run forth horizontally in the earthy \\nwhich are their horizontal roots. \\n§ 9,57. \\nAnatomy shows us, that in herbaceous and \\nbiennial plants the adducent and pneumatic vessels \\nform a circle in the root, the inside of which is close \\ncompressed, the outside lined with cellular texture. \\nThe reducent vessels lie in this last ; the lymphatics \\nwithout apertures in the epidermis. Roots are quite \\ndestitute of pith ; we never meet with more than one \\nvascular circle, for as the duration of the first is \\nonly that of a year, or a few months, the new circle \\ncannot attach itself to the old. One exception to \\nthis we have in the beet, (Beta mlgarisj, which is \\na biennial plant ; its root, when about a year old, \\nhas from five to eight of these vascular circles, as is \\n\\nii88 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC« \\nabundantly evident to any onewhohasobserved the beet. \\nIt follows, therefore, that beets produce them more \\nthan once, and they make an exception to the com- \\nmon rule, which is worthy the notice of physiologists. \\nUnder shrubs, which have no bulbs, knobs or \\ncreeping roots, are provided with a concentrated cir- \\ncle of adducent and air vessels, which is surrounded \\nwith a stronEf cellular texure inclosed in the external \\ninteguments. Like all other roots they are quite \\ndestitute of the tube of pith. A new circle is formed \\nevery year in such a manner that, at the part which \\nlies nearest to the surface, we can determine pre- \\ncisely the age of the circle by the number of the \\nrings. The smallest roots last many years, and are \\naccording to the difference of the species revived by \\nnew roots which supply the place of the old ones \\nwhen decayed. \\nThis is different in the creeping, tuberous and firm \\nbulbous roots. They have, according to their species, \\ntheir vessels in a circle closer to the centre, or more \\nor less distant from it. They are, however, annual- \\nly renewed, and the old ones die. On this account \\nwe fmd in most of them, for few live more than one \\nyear, only one circle. \\nBulbs, {§ 63. 1. 2. 3.), have at their bas\\'.- a fleshy \\nbottom, from which radicles and new bulbs shoot \\nforth. This consists of a reticular plexus c !\\' vessels, \\nwhich are not circular as in other roots. \\nThese plants change their station, and m cfemmon \\n\\nrilYSIOLOGY% \\n291 \\nanimals, move from one place to another. Tlie \\ncreeping root runs forth under ground, the branch \\nfrom which the new shoot arose dies, and the young \\nroot now becomes attached to a distant spot. The \\npalmated and testiculated root, 12. n. 35. 36.), con- \\nsist, as we saw before, of two knobs, one of which \\ncompletely dries up, and on llie opposite side a new \\none is formed. This happens every year, and the \\nplant in this way, after many years, appears on a \\ndifferent spot. Solid bulbs, {§ IG. n. 47.), especial- \\nly the bulb of the Colcbicum autuimiale, undergo \\nthe same change ; on the side of the old bulb a new \\none appears, the old one decays, and the whole at \\nlast becomes attached to neillier place, and this is \\nthe case with most bulbs and tuberous roots *. \\nVery remarkable, and deserving particular atten- \\ntion is the choice of food, which has been observed \\nin some of the creeping roots. A strawberry plant, \\nin a garden of excellent soil, was planted in a parti- \\ncular spot filled with sterile sand. Stalks and roots \\nall grew out towards the sides where the good soil \\nwas, but the main plant decayed. Several other re- \\nmarkable instances are, at present, inexplicable, so \\nlittle do we know of the physiology of plants. \\n* The bitten root (§ 12. n. 8.), has at first a perpendicu- \\nlar direction. After the first year the perpendicular root \\nbecomes ligneous, and on its sides new branches shoot out. \\nThe old main root must decay, and consequently putrifies ; \\nand this gives it its peculiar form. \\nT \\n\\n292 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\n§ 260. \\nThe descending stem, {§ 10), is probably compor \\nsed of the stalk of the root, radicles, knobs or bulbs \\nof various form, and these parts are almost always \\ncovered with fibres, which, like leaves, are renewed \\nevery year. \\nIn spring and autumn, and even in winter, when \\nevery thing is covered with snow, new ones, in cold \\nand temperate climates, spring in place of the old \\ndry ones. In warm and hot climates this happens \\nduring the rainy season, therefore always at a period \\nwhen the vegetable world appears to sleep. The \\nradicles grow in the following manner : a small \\nbundle of air-vessels lengthens, pierces the cutis, and \\nruns into the ground. It is enclosed in a delicate \\ncellular texture, covered by a thin membrane. Thus \\nthe extreme point of such a radicle is merely the \\nend of the spiral vessels, which absorbs the necessary \\nfood from the soil. Those fibres, which are never \\nwanting in earthy plants, cannot perform this func- \\ntion of taking up food longer than one summer, after \\nwhich they must be succeeded by new ones. \\n§ 261. \\nAll plants do not grow in earth, and tb.erefore the \\nvoots of some does not enter the ground. The \\nparasitic plants are of this kind. The Cuscuta \\neu?vpoea, when it germinates, lengthens its fili- \\nform plumule, winds round neighbouring growing \\nplants, as flax, nettles, &:c. and runs along them. \\nIts rostel decays, and along the whole surface of tlie \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n2.93 \\nfiliform branching stalka kind of warts shoot out, \\nwhere it rests upon the other plants, serving as roots. \\nAlgae, but especially Lichens, are, by similar warts, \\nattached to the trunk of trees, and few pierce their \\nexternal membrane. The Sphacriae grow mostly on \\nthe inner bark of old decayed trees ; they pierce or \\nelevate the external membrane, and are firmly at- \\ntached by wart-like roots. The misletoe, (Viscum \\nalbum), pervades with its roots the woody part of \\nbranches, and becomes intimately blended with it. \\nAmongst the numerous species of parasitic plants \\nwhich the torrid zone produces, one species is parti- \\ncularly distinguished, which grows abundantly in the \\nIndies beyond the Ganges, the Epidendrum fio^ \\na\\'erisj for it grows and blossoms in the air, when \\nhung up in a room. Mr Loureiro, who saw this him- \\nself, assures us, that it vegetates himg from the ceil- \\nings of rooms for years, and is remarkably reviving \\nto the inhabitants by the fine odour of its blossoms. \\nLantaria chinensis and Rhapis arundinacea, t^s \\nwell as some other small palms, are remarkable from \\nhaving a part of their root next the stump, springing \\nfrom the earth, whence they have the appearance of \\nbeing attached to a withered stump. \\nThe root is indeed, in the strictest signification, the \\nplant itself. The stalks, leaves, aud Howers issuing \\nfrom it, are only its elongations which it makes on \\npurpose to get proper nourishment. These may be \\ncutoff, and the root will always again throw out new \\nelongations. The root rnay be divided, and each \\nT 2 \\n\\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANr, ETC. \\npart will form a plant by itself ; not so the stem, \\nexcept in some ligneous plants, where the stem \\nis merely the root elongated. Resinous or dry })lants, \\nas Pinus, Erica, Rhododendrum, are an exception to \\nthis, as in them the stem can rarely be injured, with- \\nout injuring the whole plant. \\n§ 263. \\nMany experiments made by inverting plants, prove \\nclearly that the descending stem is not different \\nfrom the stalk above ground. If a plumb or cherry \\ntree, not too thick, be bent with its top towards the \\nground in the autumnal season, one half of the top \\nburied in the ground, and one half of the roots care-! \\nfully taken out of the earth, covered at first with \\nmoss, and then gradually left quite uncovered ; if af- \\nterwards, in the foUowiijg year, the same is done \\nwith the rest of the top of the tree and the roots, the \\ntree will shoot forth leaves on the branches of the \\nroot, and roots from those of its top, and in due \\ntime the root will come to blossom and bear fruit. \\nA willow is best adapted for making this experiment \\nin a short time, and with success*. \\nWe have seen, that the root arises from the rostel \\nof the seed, and from the plumule, which is always \\n* Counsellor Mcilicus has made this observation, that the \\npith of a stalk planted in the ground, in becoming root groAvs \\ndry, and at last decays. But whether the roots of ligneous \\nplants which arc raised above ground, receive pith in assu- \\nming the appearance of stalks, is not sufficiently ascertained. \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\nbending uppermost, the upper part of the plant above \\nground, whatever its shape may be. \\nThe stem of herbs and shrubs, as well as the \\ntrunk, tlie scape and the stalk, in short, all the varie- \\nties of the stem, have a channel full of pith, surround- \\ned with a rin^ of adducent and air vessels. In the \\ncellular texture lie the reduccnt vessels. The cellu- \\nlar texture, and membrane full of lymphatics, enclose \\nthe whole. The ring which the larger vessels form, \\naccords w ith the form of the plant, triangular, penta- \\ngonal, or hexagonal. \\nThe same happens in the growth of the stems of \\ntrees and shrubs during the first year. Every year a \\nnew bundle of adducent and air vessels in a circular \\nform is added externallv to the old ones. The in- \\nnermost bundles of vessels are more and more com- \\npressed, till the pith at last, except where this is na- \\ntural to some shrubs and trees, entirely disappears, \\nor is compressed to a very small point. The inte- \\nrior vascular circles become annually more dense^ \\nand at last get so hard, as to form what is called \\nwood. The less, or half-indurated external circles, \\nconstitute the alburnum, and the outermost one, \\nwhich is just newly formed, is now called the inner \\nbark. This last, then, is a circle round the stem of \\nthe tree, consisting of numerous, young, new-formed \\nvascular bundles. It is divided into two parts, the \\nexterior layer changing into bark, the interior first \\nforming the alburnum, and then the wood. The \\nbark, in ligneous plants as well as in herbs, is green \\nknd vascular; but as soon as it grows older, its green \\ncolour changes into brown ; still the lymphatics re- \\nT 3 \\n\\nL\\\\96 PllINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\ntain tlieir power. But the more the tree advances in \\nage, the browner and darker the bark grows ; it \\ncracks, and the function of expiration cannot go on \\nas before, nor are the vessels in the cuticle any \\nlonger visible. Some trees and shrubs lose their \\nbark annually, and reproduce a new one from the \\ninner bark. As instances may be given, the Platanus \\noccidentalism and the Vo\\\\.eni\\\\\\\\\\\\di fruticosa. \\nThe age of a tree or shrub may be easily deter- \\nmined by the number of these ligneous circles, upon \\ncutting the stem off, close to the root. In the same \\nmanner the main root shows most accurately the age \\nby its ligneous circles, when cut directly below the \\nsurface of the ground. \\nIn the Palmae, however, according to Daubenton\\'s \\nobservation, this is very different. For if we cut a \\nstem horizontally through, we find no difference be- \\ntween an old or young tree. In them the vascular \\nbundles do not dispose themselves in a circular \\nform. They consist of vessels running in a straight \\nline, without regular order, and enclosed by a cellular \\nmembrane. Nor do they grow thicker annually or \\npossess proper bark, but this is formed by the rem- \\nnants of the leaves. Daubenton is not inclined to \\nassign the name of wood to their substance, and pro- \\nposes, if it were to be given to their fibrous substance, \\nthe name of lignum fasciculahm, to distinguish it \\nfrom the common wood, which he calls lignum reti- \\nciilatum. As the Palmae are destitute of branches, \\ntheir leaves do not arise from buds, but are in fact \\nonly small separated bundles of vessels of the stem, \\nwhich expand in a leafy form. Hence it is that \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n297 \\nthe under part of the petiolus remains and forms the \\nbark. \\n§ \\nIf the vascular bundles of a tree or shrub remain \\nin a straight direction, the stem ascends without \\nforming any branches. The new shoots in the hazel, \\n(Corylus A\\'vellana J, Berberis vulgaris, and all which \\nthe trunk of trees produced when lopped, are a proof \\nof this. As soon, however, as the air-vessels become \\nconvoluted, and form a knot, branches are formed. \\nBy assistance of art such straight shoots may be \\nbrought to branch, by making a transverse incision \\nthrough their bark. The separated air-vessels heal \\nthe lips of the wound, are several times convoluted, \\nand growing larger are obliged to form more gems \\nfrom which branches arise. \\n§ 9.66. \\nThe growth of ligneous plants admits of five va- \\nrieties : \\n1 . Trees and shrubs, ( Arbores tt frutices), have \\ntheir stems beset with leaves. On the base of each \\npetiolus a bud or gem is formed, which again be- \\ncomes a leafy branch, provided with gems formed in \\nthe same manner. If the main shoot srows at first \\nin a straight line to a certain height without the buds \\non its sides being able, on account of the too hasty \\ncirculation of the sap, to form themselves into \\nbranches, or these, should they really be formed, not \\nbe able to grow any more, such a plant then becomes \\na tree, which has a straight and simple stem, with a \\nT 4i \\n\\nPUINCIl\\'LES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nbranching divided top. But if the stem divides near \\nthe root, when the sap circulates more slowly, and \\neach bud can unfold a branch, then this plant is a \\nshrub. By means of change of soil, place, climate, \\nand by art, trees may be changed into shrubs, and \\nlice versa. \\n% Under shrubs, (Frutices minores), have very \\nleafy branches, which, however, are very small, and \\nonly deposit a very delicate circle of vessels. Hence \\nevery bud attached to a petiolus is not then really \\nevolved, as their branches are very few. They are \\nbesides, as their branches are so delicate, of short \\nduration, and often replace their old decayed bran- \\nches, by young shoots from the roots. \\n3. The pine tribe, (arbores acerosae), have, how- \\never, very leafy branches, which on their extreme \\npoints only, and on one spot, evolve several buds, of \\nwhich that in the middle grows in a straight direc- \\ntion, the other unfolding on its sides. Hence the \\nappearance of some pines like that of a twirling \\nstick, by which, as every year a new one is added, \\nthe age of the tree may be found. \\n4. Shrubby gramina, ( gramiiia fruticosa J, have a \\nknotty culm, with attached and dispersed leaves. \\nEach knot sends forth branches, but withoat a knot \\nno branches appear. \\n- 5. Palmae et lAXvdi frutescentia. These have a \\nsimple stem, which has leaves only at its top ; and \\nif this is injured, the stem decays. The last some- \\ntimes retain their life by lateral branches, but with \\nthe loss of the beauty of their growth and ap- \\npearanpe. \\n\\nPMYSIOLOGV. \\n299 \\nBesides tlie\\'se varieties of ligneous plants, there are \\nmany which make a transition from one to the other. \\nThe Palms are incontest\\'ibly the most beautiful of \\nall ligneous stems, which kind nature has bestowed on \\nt4ie warm climates exclusively. But after them, the \\nparticular growth of some West India trees, which \\nare not of the palm tribe, deserve notice. To those \\nbelong the genera Theophrasta and Spathelia. They \\nhave a simple, very high, branchless stem, which in \\nits whole surface is ornamented with bundles of \\nleaves. How wonderful must be the appearance of a \\nlandscape with groupes of such trees ! \\nA tree Avhich grows in Africa, on the Senegal, pre- \\nsents the most irregular appearance, and without \\nquestion is the thickest tree on the globe. It is the \\nAdansonia digitata. Its stem is only ten or twelve \\nfeet high, but so thick that its diameter is found to \\nbe from 25 to 30 feet. Its circumference, therefore, \\nis from about 75 to 90 feet. Its top is very re- \\nmarkable, for numerous and thick branches, of from \\n30 to 60 feet in length, run out from it in all direc- \\ntions. \"VVe ought, therefore, not to be surprised tliat \\nsometimes the hollow trunk of the Adansonia is the \\nabode of several negro families. \\nNot less wonderful is the tree called Rhizophora \\nmangle, which bends its branches perpendicularly to \\nthe ground, and changes them into stems, so that \\none single tree covers the muddy rivers under the \\ntropics of Asia, Africa, and America, for more than \\na mile, with a forest consisting of numberless stems. \\n\\nSOO 1»RINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nwhich at the top have the appearance of a close-clip- \\nped bower. \\n. § 2G8. \\nBut there are varieties of stems, which at first sight \\nscarcely would be counted as such ; and which also \\nin regard to the structure of their vessels, are dif- \\nferent. The whole genus Cactus with its varieties \\nis an instance of this kind : fig. 233, represents a \\nstem of it. The different links which commonly are \\ntaken for leaves, are parts of the stem. The leaves \\nthemselves are subulate, fleshy points, which on their \\nbase are covered with small prickles. They fall off, \\nas soon as a bark is properly formed, and their for- \\nmer place is marked by the remaining bundles of \\nprickles. The stem of some species of the genus \\nEuphorbia, Cacalia and Stapelia, is of the same na- \\nture. The links of the stem consist of a double net- \\nAvork of air and adducent vessels ; the whole is sur- \\nrounded with a dense, cellular texture, or a fleshy- \\nsubstance, and the cutis itself, has net-work of lym- \\nphatic vessels with apertures. \\nThe thorn, (§ 67), is, with regard to its anatomi- \\ncal structure, to be considered as a ligneous stem, \\nand does in no respect differ from it. It arises ge- \\nnerally from an incompletely evolved bud, which has \\nbegun to form itself, but wanting a proper supply of \\nnourishment, remains only in form of a very short, \\nsharp, and bare twig. It is like the woody stem of \\na tree or shrub, formed of the aii\\' and adducent ves- \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n301 \\nsels, which have grown completely hard. It there- \\nfore remains fixed, though the bark be taken off. \\nThat it arises from a want of food is easily proved \\nby the cultivation of thorny plants. Most species \\nof our fruit trees have thorns, but having been sup- \\nplied in our gardens with extra food, the thorns be- \\ncome boughs, and at last disappear entirely. Only \\nsuch plants as the black thorn, which are almost \\ncovered with thorns, do not lose them entirely by \\nthat treatment, thouojh their number is alwavs di- \\nminished. \\nNearly the same thing takes place in thorns, which \\nare not formed from imperfectly evolved buds, but \\nare other parts of plants, changed in their appear- \\nance. Sometimes the petioli of pinnate leaves, when \\nthey remain after the leaves have dropped off, be- \\ncome thorns, as in Astragalus Tragacantha, and other \\nspecies of that genus. On the petiole they grow \\nlarger, sharper, and assume, after the flower and \\nfruit have fallen off, the shape of thorns ; for in- \\nstance, Hedysarum cornutim : or lastly, the stipu- \\nlae become sharp, ligneous, remain and change into \\nthorns, for instance in the Mimosa. Such changes, \\nwhich frequently occur, especially in oriental plants, \\nremain uniform or constant. \\nJ 270. \\nThe prickle, (J 68), is a prolongation of the cutis, \\nand can therefore be taken off alon^ with it. This \\nconsists of reticular, more or less expanded, addu- \\ncent vessels, and a few air vessels, and is covered \\nwith the vascular cuti«. Tiie most careful cultiva- \\n\\n302 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\ntion cannot convert a prickle into a shoot, as its air \\nvessels become very rapidly ligneous, and separate \\nfrom the inner bark, and it is therefore only kept \\nfrom dropping off, by the covering cutis. Prickles \\nhave sometimes a peculiar shape ; they are almost ot \\nthe shape of contorted tendrils in Nauclea aculeata \\nand oiher plants. Even the stipulae of some plants \\nare converted into prickles, for instance, Robinia \\npseudacacia, Berberis vulgaris^ &c. \\n§ 271. \\nTendrils have the same structure of vessels, in \\nherbaceous .stems. They are, in fact, petioli, (§ 62), \\n-without the leafy expansion, but which, having not \\nwasted their sap in the formation of leaves, have \\ngrown longer, and on this account have become too \\nfeeble to keep their straight direction. Hence arises \\ntheir twisted shape. It appears, as if the diminish- \\ned force of the current of air had a particular in- \\nfluence upon the tendril. For each plant that sup- \\nports itself by tendrils, when distant from a wall, tree \\nor shrub, sends out all its tendrils towards that side \\non which the plant is to attach itself. At least this \\nphenomenon can scarcely be explained in any other \\nway. \\n§ 272. \\nThe pith which is found in the centre of stems, \\n(§ 232), is a spongy cellular texture, which com- \\nmonly is of a remarkably splendid white colour. It \\nis not the least different from cellular texture, and \\nin no respect like the spinal marrow of animals. Na- \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGV. \\n303 \\nture seems to have provided plants with it on pur- \\npose to deposit in it a store pf n)oisture, that they \\nmay not suffer during drought. Hence all trees and \\nshrubs have it, but as soon as they grow older, they \\nneed it no longer, the wood being an excellent sub- \\nstitute. On the same account it is unnecessary in \\nwater plants, as they very rarely suffer from drought ; \\nall of them have a hollow stem, without any pith. \\n§ 273. \\nThe gem or bud is the embryo of a future brancJi, \\nand its anatomy, therefore, perfectly coincides with \\nthe anatomy of the stems and leaves, as they are in- \\nclosed in it, in small compass. The period of their \\nformation differs in different plants. In cold regions \\nthe bud is formed in autumn, covered with a great \\nmany scales, and so prepared for the mild spring. \\nIn warm and hot regions this is diffeicnt; there no \\npernicious frost destroys the blossoms of the spring, \\nand cold does not impair the vital power of the ve- \\ngetable creation, therefore no precaution was neces- \\nsary. The buds unfold themselves immediately from \\nthe bark into branches, without having remained there \\nin the form of buds for any length of time. How- \\never, we meet with exceptions to this rule. Hot \\nclimates too, have some bud-bearing plants, \\nand we possess a few shrubs, especially the \\nHhnnmus J\\'rcmgu la, which never buds. Each bud \\nunfolds a branch with leaves, which at the base \\nof each petiole, again produces buds. In this man- \\nner their growth continues. J^ut this evolution of \\nbuds, from buds, would continue without stopping, \\nwere it not so regulated^ that each bud, as soon as \\n\\n304 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nthe blossoms and fruits are perfectly formed, de- \\ncays. The evolution of the flowers, and afterwards \\nof the fruit, constitutes the invincible barrier to the \\ngrowth of the branches. \\nEach bud, like all vegetable productions, is form- \\ned by the spiral vessels. Cutting a bud in a trans- \\nverse direction, a white spot appears, continued \\nto the very extremity of the bud, and this snow-white \\ncontinuation is nothing else than a bundle of air-ves- \\nsels. If the same is done at an^ early period, an \\nelongation of a small bundle of the spiral vessels \\nis found. \\n§ 274. \\nThe leaves are composed of the same vessels of \\nwhich the root, stems, and other parts of vegetables \\nconsist. But the manner in which they are disposed \\npresents a remarkable difference. A great bundle \\nof vessels enters the base of the leaf, and divides \\non its surface in a reticular manner, anastomosing \\nlike plants, {§ 244). On this anatomosing of the \\nvessels of leaves depends their form, and as it differs \\nin each plant, we need not be surprised at the di- \\nversity of leaves. If the large vascular fascicle di- \\nvides in three great divisions, a triangular leaf is form- \\ned ; if it divides in more, then we see all tlie species \\nof compound leaves arise, which we have described \\nin the Terminology. If, for instance, the vascular \\nfascicle at the base of the leaf splits into smaller ones, \\na nerved leaf is formed. But if it run straight for- \\nward, emitting single fascicles on its sides, then we \\nhave a veined leaf. If tliere are on the margins of the \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n305 \\nleaf numerous anastomoses, such a leaf is then call- \\ned folium integerrimum. But if the fascicles spread \\nin small unconnected branches towards the mar^rin, \\nthe leaf becomes, according to circumstances, ser- \\nrated, dentated, crenate, and so forth. \\nThese bundles of vessels in leaves are composed \\nof air and adducent vessels. The net-work they \\nform, is in both its surfaces covered with cellular \\ntexture, in which the reducent vessels lie. And the \\nexternal membrane or cutis which on both sides in- \\nvests the cellular texture, is provided with innume- \\nrable lymphatic vessels, (J 240), and their exhaling \\npores. \\nThe footstalk of leaves resembles in its structure \\nthat of the stem, except that tiie air-vessels on its \\nbase by their convolutions form a knot, which serves \\nfor the evolution of the bud, their direction being \\nthus chanijed. This knot is of the same nature as \\nthe supporter of a bulb. In rooty plants, radicles \\nare observed to shoot out, as also in sessile leaves, \\nor such as want the footstalk, we seldom find \\nsuch a knot, and therefore they will not always pro- \\nduce buds at their base. \\nJ 275. \\nOf all the parts of plants, the leaves shew a \\nparticular irritability ; especially in compounded \\nleaves. Merely by touching the leaves of Mimo- \\nsa pudica, seiisitwa, casta, Oxalis sensltha, Smi- \\nthia sensitiva and many others, they instantly con- \\ntract. If single leaves, or the main footstalk be \\ntouched, they remain eontracted for some minutes. \\n\\nS06 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANV, £TC. \\nAlmo3t all triangular leaves, and leaves which \\nure composed of several small ones, contract at \\nnight, like the above plants, in such a manner that \\none leaf covers the other, and the whole becomes \\ncompressed. Whoever will take the trouble to ex- \\namine the plants of a garden at night-time with a \\nlantern in his hand, will find several of them in this \\nstate, which has been called sleep, {§ 7). There \\nare plants which, at a certain hour in the day, open \\nand close their leaves. Du Hamel made experi- \\nments with the I\\\\limosa scnsitha, which at a certain \\nhour in the evening shuts its leaves, and again at:, a \\ncertain time opens them. He put this plant in a \\nleathern trunk, covered with woollen blankets, and \\nfound that its leaves opened at a certain hour in the \\nmorning, and again were shut up in the evening. \\nIt has been alledged, that this phenomenon varies \\nin its period, when going on in vacuo. A South A- \\nnierican shrub (Porhera hijgrometricu\\'), uniformly \\ncontracts its feathered leaves, whenever it is going \\nto rain, and is the surest foreteller of the weather \\nthat one can have. \\nA plant which grows in the marshes of South Ca- \\nrolina, Dionoea Muscipula has a singularly con.struct- \\ned leaf. At the apex of a lanceolate leaf an elonga- \\ntion is seen armed with short prickles, which as soon \\nas an insect or other small body is put upon it, shuts \\nitself, and does not open, till the body caught by it \\nbecomes quiet. \\nThe species of Drosera rotundifolia and longifo- \\n/ia, the leaves of which are planted on their margins \\nand surtaces with petioled glands, contract, accord- \\n\\nt»HYSIOLOGY. \\n505 \\ning to Roth\\'s observations, when stimulated, though \\nvery slowly. \\nA species of Filix in North America, the Onoclea \\nsensibilis, has got this appellation merely from the \\ncircumstance, that its young leaves, when they begin \\nto unfold themselves, shrink upon the least touch. \\nIn other respects, this plant shows no symptoms of \\nirritability. The Nepenthes distillatoria, growing in \\nCeylon, has on the apex of its leaves a leaf-like aS\\' \\ncklium, {§ 52), of which fig. 28. is a representation, \\nwhich at times opens and closes, and is even filled \\nwith water. This takes place also in a species of \\nthis genus indigenous in Amboyna. \\nOf all plants, however, in this respect the most \\nsingular is the Hedysarum gijrans, growing on the \\nbanks of the Ganges. It has trifoliate leaves, of \\nwhich the central one is larger than the two others. \\nAll these leaves move spontaneously. The large \\none rises backwards, up and down, the two smaller \\nleaves at the sides have the same movement, only \\nsomewhat vigorous. Laying hold of these leaves, \\nand then removing the hand, quickens their motions, \\nas if they were to make up for the lost time, till at \\nlast they return to their former slower motion. No \\nparticular stimulus seems to act on them, and they \\ndo not contract like other irritable plants. Nor does \\nthis motion of the leaves depend on sun light, for \\nthey move in light as well as in the dark, even when \\nthe plant is perfectly asleep. It is besides re- \\nmarkable, that the leaves in the height of erection, \\nand during very warm days, like the animal muscu- \\nlar fibre, have a tremulous motion. \\nu \\n\\n308 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nits evolution has quite a different motion of sap frora \\nwhat it has when in leaf. \\nVarious conjectures have been formed by other \\nphysiologists respecting the circulation of sap in the \\nvegetable kingdom. Some think that the sap ascends \\nonly through the vessels of the inner bark. Others \\nassert that it ascends to the wood through the roots \\nand descends through the cortex. Of this opinion \\nare those who have injected plants with coloured \\nliquids. From their observations it would appear \\nthat the coloured juice proceeds from the substance \\nof the root into the wood, and hence is communicat- \\ned to the leaves, from which it finds its way back \\nthrough the cortex. \\n§ 278. \\nShould we now admit with Hales, that the sap \\nrises only by means of attraction, air and heat, \\nin the vessels of vegetables ; it necessarily follows, \\nthat the motion must be slower in spring than in \\nsummer. Now, according to Hales\\'s own experi- \\nments> the rapidity with which the sap of the vine \\nis moved in spring is five times greater than the cir- \\nculation of blood in the arteries of a horse. This \\nvelocity diminishes greatly in summer, and in autumn \\nquite disappears. If heat were the cause of motion \\nin the vegetable juice, it should in summer, by the \\nincrease of warmth, be much stronger than in spring. \\nAnd hence it is perfectly obvious that this pheno- \\nmenon depends, not on any mechanical cause, but \\nsimply on the irritability of the vessels. \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY, \\n309 \\nBrugmanns has endeavoured to prove the irritabi- \\nlity of vessels, by showing that the amputated bran- \\nches of the Euphorbia Lathyris and Myrsinites which \\nemit a great quantity of miliv, cease to do so, as soon \\nas the cut part is anointed with a solution of alum \\nand sulphate of iron, so diluted that it leaves no \\nstain on paper. \\nVan Marum repeated this experiment but did not \\nobtain the same result. Uslar, however, has ob- \\nserved that the amputated stalk of Euphorbia exi- \\ngua and sylvatica when immersed in a solution of \\nalum or acetous acid, immediately, or at least in a \\nshort time after, ceased to flow. \\nVan Marum demonstrates, by several remarkable \\nexperiments, the irritability of vessels. He poured \\nan electric stream over the branches of Euphorbia \\nLathyris^ as well as through the whole plant of E. \\nEsula and CyparissuSj for the space of 20 to 30 se- \\nconds. On intersecting them, it was found that they \\ndid not emit any milky juice, though, by compres- \\nsion, some of it was observed to drop. He made \\nthe same experiment on the boughs of the Ficus \\nCarica which were exposed for 15 seconds to an \\nelectric stream. Girtanner asserts, that, oxygen is a \\nstimulus to plants ; that oxygen has a closer connexion \\nwith the vegetable fibre than with other bodies ; \\' \\nthat all bodies which rapidly absorb oxygen, are \\nstimuli to plants, and must promote their growth. \\nAccording to this theory the experiments of Mr \\nHumboldt which he made on the germination of \\nplants, (^255) may be very well explained; and \\nthe observations of Ingenhouss and others confirm. \\n\\n3^0 PRINCIPLES OF 50TANV, ETC. \\nthe opinion that corn and other vegetables, in a bad \\nsoil, when sprinkled vvith well diluted sulphuric j^cid, \\ngrow jqst as well ag if they had been plentifully ni^n» \\ni^red. We leari) ivlso from chemistry, that oxygen \\nfrom the fitrposphere very ea&ily cppibines with th^ \\ndifferent sppcie^ of earths and stone, particulav* \\nly, with vegetable mould, (humus). It is wqU \\nknowq tQ every gardener and forester, that trees \\nplanted in spring grow so much better by having had \\ntheir holes diggec^ in autumn, which during tlie win^- \\ntpr wer^ exppsed to the influence of the air, \\nper^ne\"^^ have also shown, that soils which have \\nbeen dug into loose heape Qf earth frequently stirred \\na|id then ej^ppsed for half a year to the influence of \\nthe air, produce a richer crop than if they hftd bee« \\nnft^nured, and retain this fryitfuJoQS^ \\\\ox\\\\g^x \\\\b%n by- \\nthe ^pplicatioiii qf m^pwr^s. \\nBut besides th^ mere oxygen, thcr« ai^ other bo- \\ndies which act as stimuli upon plants. Most of \\nthese, however, appear only in an active statie, for \\nthis reason, that they eitlier contain oxygen or dis- \\nsolve it. \\nWell or river water, considered as an aliment, \\nbeing decomposed in the vegetabie process, some- \\ntimes also, constitutes a stimulus. Rain water is \\nmuch more bencfecial to plants, than, any other, \\ncau&e, according to Hassenfi\"az^s investigation, it \\ncontains more oxygen. Caloric is an excellent sti-^ \\nmulus to vegetables, as it renders oxygen gaseous \\nand moistures more fluid : consequently, the influ-. \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n311 \\nence of this matter becomes more powerful. Only, \\nthe degree of it must be proportioned to the vegeta- \\nble fibre. Thus plants at the tropics will sustniii \\nmore heat than mountain plants or those at the \\npoles. \\nMuriate of Ammonia, according to Brugmann\\'s \\nobservations, promotes vegetation. The branch of a \\nservice tree was put into pure water, another into a \\nsolution of muriate of ammonia ; in 24 hours tlie \\nformer imbibed i-12ths, the latter 10-]2thsof the \\nliquid ; and hence we may draw the probable con- \\nclusion that the muriate of ammonia, by its sti- \\nmulus, increased the activity of the vessels. Nitrate \\nof potash is used by the Dutch gardeners as a means \\nof promoting growth. The bulbs of narcissuses, \\nhyacinths and other vegetables, grow much faster \\nin water where this neutral salt is dissolved. Troms- \\ndorf found also tliat a sprig of the Mentha piperita \\nbecame 378 grains heavier in a solution of nitre, \\nwhereas, a sprig in common water gained but 145 \\ngrains in weight. Barton however, directly maintains \\nthe contrary, because a few grains of nitrate of potash \\ntilled a Kalmia. But it is easy to conceive that a mo- \\nderate stimulus to some plants, may be over violent \\nand destructive to others. \\nBarton found that in water in which camphor was \\ndiffused, a decayed twig rapidly recovered, which \\ndid not happen when it was placed in common wa- \\nter. A decayed branch of Liriodendron tulipijera \\nand a withered flower of the yellow Iris recovered \\nin it and remained long fre$h. I myself tried this \\nwith a branch of Silene pemlula^ the flowers of whicli \\nu 4 \\n\\n312 \\nPKlNCrriES OF BOTANr, ETC. \\nwere quite shrivelled ; in an hour\\'s time I found the \\npetals again perfectly expanded, as if just evolved. \\nIs it the hydrogen of the Camphor which stimulates \\nthe vegetable fibre to such a degree, as to produce \\nthis phenomenon ? or is it a consequence of the \\ncomposition of the camphor, that only the exact \\nproportion of carbon, which is found combined with \\nhydrogen in camphor, can stimulate the fibres ? This \\nremains to be determined. \\nLight likewise is a very powerful stimulus of the \\nvegetable fibre. Every body knows that hot-house \\nplants incline their stalks and leaves always towards \\nthe windows. A j)lant which has been confined for \\ndays in a dark room will, as soon as some light is \\nadmitted, however small the aperture be through \\nwhich it passes, bend its stalks towards the light. \\nWho does not know, that the species of Lupinus, \\nespecially Lupinus luteus, turn in the open air their \\nleaves and stalks towards the sun, and follow its \\ncourse in so steady a manner, as to enable us to \\nspecify the hour of the day from their direction ? \\nLiglit is farther of particular service to vegetables \\nin promoting the decomposition of the absorbed \\nwater, and separation of the oxygen ; for when this \\noxygen gas is accumulated in vegetables, all their \\nparts become white, as meiy be seen from plants \\nwhich vegetate in the dark. Even the light of a \\nlamp effects the separation of the oxygen, as \\nan experiment of ^liich 1 was eye witness, fully \\nproves, viz. that of Mr Humboldt, who rendered \\nLepidium sat mm which had grown up in a dark \\n\\nPHYSJOLOCr. \\n313 \\ncellar green, by the faint glimmering of a lamp kept \\nunder it several days. \\nAll plants cannot support the stimulus of strong \\nand constant light. There appears to be a determi- \\nnate degree of this stimulus, which they cannot, \\nwithout injury exceed. As young plants are much \\nmore susceptible than grown up ones, they thrive \\nbest in the shade. All forest plants are destroyed \\nby too much light. This is proved by the observa- \\ntions of Medicus, Desfontaines and Uslar, wiio \\nfound that the irritability of plants is strongest \\nin the morning, fainter at mid-day, and fainter still \\nin the evening. Sennebier has made the experiment \\nof separating the rays of hght, in order to discover \\nwhich of them is most favourable to vegetation, and \\nhe found, that plants of Lettuce grow best in the \\n3\\'ellow, and next in the violet. Those on which the \\ninvisible ray fell, came nearest to those which stand \\nfree in the collected light. \\n§ 2S0. \\nThe irritability of the vegetable fibre is destroyed \\nby all stimuli when they are too powerful or too long \\ncontinued. Every stimulus must be proportioned \\nto the irritability of the fibre ; in proof of which \\nmay be adduced all subterraneous plants and all the \\nspecies of Boletus : for the knowledge of which we \\nare indebted to the researches of Scopoli and Hum- \\nboldt. These plants require a very small quantity \\nof oxygen to promote their growth, and therefore \\nas soon as they are brought into the open air, they \\ndecay. This is even proved by the well known ob\\' \\n\\n314, \\nPUrNClPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nscrvation, that rooms or repositories which are fusty \\nor mouldy, are freed from this inconvenience by the \\nadmission of the air. \\nOpium will destroy the irritabiUty of plants ; by it \\nthe irritability of Hedysarum gyrans and Mimosa \\npudica was greatly impaired, and almost completely \\ndestroyed. \\nVegetables die very soon in carbonic acid gas ; as \\nwell as in nitrogen and hydrogen gas. In the last of \\nthese, plants die immediately, but if it is mixed with \\na little oxygen gas, they live for a short while and \\ngrow very luxuriantly. \\nMr Humboldt on the 14th February 1792 put a \\ngerminating bulb of the Crocus vernitSj which he \\nhad planted, into one of the celebrated mines of \\nFreyberg, several fathoms under ground. In this \\nmine the air was so much contaminated with hydro- \\ngen gas^ that his candle was extinguished, and his \\nlungs became sensibly affected. The germ of the \\nbulb soon evolved, tlie leaves became green, the \\nflowers yellow, and the anthers even full of pollen ; \\nbut on the J 7th the whole plant suddenly began to \\nputvily. Several plants shewed the same result. The \\nhydrogen gas cannot however be considered as a; \\nstimulus of vegetables, as in its pure state it kills \\nplants, and only when mixed with oxygen shews tlie \\nabove plienomena. Plants live so long only, as \\nthey can exhale oxygen ; when this stops they are \\ngone. In tiie same nraimer, Sennebier and Ingen- \\nbon&s observed that plants confined in Hydrogen \\ngSK, emitted oxygen day and nigiit, but that when \\n\\nriiYSiOLoey \\n315 \\nthe oxygen gas was consumed they could no longer \\nsubsist. \\n§ 281. \\nThe above numerous observations are sufficient to \\nprove that vegetable sap is not put in motion by \\nmechanical principles, but that it is carried forward \\nby the irritability peculiar to plants. The ascent of \\nsap in warm weather and the descent of it in cold \\nweather can no longer be argued, but experiments, \\nand the analogy between plants and animals, clearly \\npoint out a circulation. For how could the juices of \\ntrees, which during winter continue bare, without \\nfoliage, and without discovering any symptom of ve- \\ngetation, be at all preserved, if in the long succession \\nof cold weather, the moisture which is found in the \\nvessels were constantly to descend. We should at last \\nnecessarily ftnd the branches quite destitute of fluid, \\nwhich is never the case. Nor is the cessation of sap, \\nor the congellation of it in very cold weather more ad- \\nmissible. We knowfrom experience thatwhen the juices \\nof delicate exotic plants are coagulated by cold, they \\nmust die. The circulation of sap must therefore take \\nplace in them, as they cannot, on account of the un- \\nfavourable season make new shoots still and survive ; \\nand, though much less vigorous, they appear to ex- \\nist in the same manner as Hybcrnating animals, such \\nas the marmot, and dormouse, which, during the \\nwinter, like amphibious animals and some insects, \\nfall into a profound sleep, and are awakened first \\nwith the returning warmth of spring. Experiments \\nhave not yet discovered how the circulation of bloQcl \\n4 \\n\\n316 \\nPRI NCI TIES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nin these species of animals adapts itself to the sea- \\nson of the year. \\nWhat has been adduced as proof of the ascent and \\ndescent of the sap in plants, is the important, but \\naltogether mistaken phenomenon, that after the \\nmiddle of January, with us after the 20th, the sap \\nenters trees. At this period it is thought to descend, \\nto be ready in the spring. But whoever tliuiks that \\ntrees, shrubs or herbs arc dead in winter, cf with- \\nout action, is much mistaken. \\nDuring the whole summer the root sends the food, \\nimbibed by its fibres, to the stem, and what the \\nstem receives from the leaves is constantly employed \\nin the formation of new parts, till either this evolu- \\ntion ceases, from the strength being exhausted, as \\nin annual plants, or till the parts above ground, \\nwhich can no longer resist the inclemency of the \\nweather, become separated, as in herbs, shrubs and \\ntrees. With the fall of the leaves in ligneous plants, \\nand Avith the drying of the stem in herbs, all their \\nvegetating powers are exhausted. The great quan- \\ntity of moisture which the root forwarded to the \\nplant, is consumed ; in trees and shrubs, it is em- \\nployed in the formation of branches, of wood, albur- \\nnum, inner bark, leaves, blossoms and fruit, as well as \\nin the formation of the root : in herbs, in the forma- \\ntion of the parts above ground, the fruit and the \\nroot itself. These fibres, which hitherto conveyed \\nthe food, begin to become brittle, and are no \\nlonger able to serve this purpose. The sap which \\ncirculates in the vessels can no longer pioduce new \\nslioots above ground, as the temperature is unfa* \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGT. \\n3\\\\7 \\nvourable. From the moment, then, that the leaves \\nof ligneous plants and the stems of herbs decay, \\nthe plant begins to form new radicles in place of tlie \\nold ones. If at this period, in the latter part of \\nautumn till the middle of January in our climates, \\na birch or walnut is bored, no sap will proceed. \\nThe tree indeed has sap, but only as much as it just \\nwants, and as suffices to form new radicles. Hence \\nfruit-trees, which had too much fruit, decay, be- \\ncause their strength by the great waste of sap is too \\nmuch exhausted. If such a tree or shrub has form- \\ned radicles, before the middle of January, those \\nactive young radicles perform their new functions. \\nThey imbibe moisture, which they deposite in the \\ncellular texture, and collect in this manner as much \\nsap as the wasting of the powers, which will be ne- \\ncessary in the next summer requires. If at this \\ntime a stem is bored, a great quantity of fluid flows \\nout, in those plants which receive a superfluity. \\nBut if at the end of January, or in February, the \\nweather becomes mild, this flow of sap ceases alto- \\ngether, and trees, if then bored for the first time, \\ngive no sap ; a stream of it is observed again when \\nthe weather becomes cold. Those who adhere to \\nthe theory of ascent and descent of the sap, say, \\nthat in warm ; weather the sap ascended too high, - \\nand in cold descended too low. This singular change, \\nhowever, of its flowing and ceasing to flow, depends \\non this, that as soon as the weather is fine and mild, \\nthe transpiration of plants goes on with greater rapi- \\ndity; the quantity of the sap, therefore, naturally \\nbecoines less ; on the contrary, in cold weather the \\n\\n318 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\ntranspiration is not considerable, and therefore the \\nsap accumulates. \\nOn this account the roots of herbaceous plants \\nwliich are collected for medicinal purposes, are more \\nefficacious in winter and spring, than in summer, \\nwhen in full leaf and flower, because, at that time, \\nthey have prepared new sap by their yofung radi- \\nces. \\n§ 282. \\nThe circulation of sap in vegetables, cannot be \\nof the same nature as it is found in quadrupeds, \\nbirds, fishes, amphibious animals and insects ; \\nelse, we should observe a point from which all the \\nfluids proceeded, and where they again meet to- \\nsether. Were there snch a circulation, the willow \\ncould not reproduce new stems from every little \\nbranch. \\nThe circulation of sap, then, must resemble that \\nwhich takes place in the polypi, as these also may \\nbe dissected into several pieces, from each of which \\nnew polypi arc again formed:. The nature of crrcu- \\nlation must be extremely various in the di^erent \\nclasses of vegetables : Impatiens Balsaminay being a \\nmeadow i)lant, whenever it is without water, imme- \\ndiately withers away ; but when water is poured upon- \\nit, in five minutes after all the leaves and the trunk \\nagain stand erect. A tree or shrub will not recover \\nso quickly. I observed a cherry tree, the stalk of \\nwhich was broken immediately under the top, and \\nin vrhich the top was attached to the stem only by \\na small stripe of bark. It was immediately fastened : \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY, Sly \\nthe buds were just opened, but the flowers were \\nstiU confined ; in about eight days after nothing was \\nobserved at the top, it bloomed rather more kixu- \\nliantly, but in a short time, all of it decayed. I have \\nobserved also in the broken off branches of fruit \\ntrees, that the fruit became ripe ; and also that fruit \\ntrees, the stems of which were frozen, still continued \\nto vegetate, till towards tlie middle of June ; they \\nthen decayed. Thus the juice of trees, which is im- \\nbibed by the root, appears to be long in reaching the \\nupper part We must then take for granted, that \\nsmall coherence by means of the bark in the broken \\ntop of {he cherry tree, and in the bough of the fruit \\ntree, had, as well as the still living wood of the con- \\ngealed fruit stem, conveyed out of the root a suffi- \\ncient quantity of sap for some time. Be that as it \\nmay, it is certain that the sap of the root is much \\nlonger, or slower in reaching the top of ligneous than \\nof herbaceous plants. A shrub the roots of which are \\ndecayed, or consumed by insects,, will for a long time \\nhave discoloured leaves, and yet live ; and will even \\nvegetate some time after its root has been destroy- \\ned. \\nIt is highly probable, that the circulation of vege- \\ntables is very complex, and Corti {§ 277), may \\nnot be far wrong when he ascribes a circulatory \\nsystem to every knot of plants. We may therefore \\nsuppose that the root imbibes the fluids, which on \\nthe admission of heat, and the gases produced by it, \\nare formed by the adducent vessels, particularly those \\nthat twine round the air vessels, are communicated \\nto the reducent vea^els by means of the cellular \\n\\n320 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\ntexture ; and are again conveyed into the posterior \\nadducent vessels through the same channels rising \\nby degrees higher and higher till they reach the \\nstalk. Here every knot that evolves a bud, appears \\nto form with the leaves, a circulatory system, which \\nby means of the passing adducent, and reducent ves- \\nsels, and of the cellular texture, is united to all the \\nother systems, and to the whole plant. According \\nto this principle, I may cut off from the stalk, a \\nsmall slip, which has only one knot, one bud, and \\none leaf, and by placing it loose in the ground, ren- \\nder it a plant. As the slip which has its own pecu- \\nliar circulation, is separated from the common cir- \\nculating system, it will be for a period in a state of \\ninaction, without evolving any new leaf, but in a \\nshort time, the vessels, which exist in this part of \\nthe stalk, viz. in the knot, the bud, and the leaf, \\nbegin to form a callus below, sending out new parts \\nthat become roots ; these young roots soon nnbibe \\nnourishment, the bud is evolved, and becomes a \\nyoung plant, in which again several systems of circu- \\nlation are found connected with the whole. The \\nfollowing observation may serve as a proof that every \\nknot has its circulatory system : If in a young sprout, \\nI cut the knot on which the bud stands, it will \\nnot grow, or produce a new plant; neither will a \\npiece of the stalk grow, in which there is no knot \\nwith the bud. As far as our observations ex- \\ntend, tlie circulation of sap cannot be explained in \\nany other manner. That, according to the ditferent- \\n\\\\y formed plants, there are more or less anomalous \\ncircumstances or exceptions, is easy to be supposed. \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY; \\n323 \\nhut of what nature is the circulation of sap in lig- \\nneous plants during winter ? In all probability, the \\njuices continue to be moved in the same general \\nmanner, and to be renovated from the root: their \\ncirculation of fluids, however, is slow, because no \\nnew parts can be formed in the open air, and \\nbecause the transpiration is considerably diminished. \\n§ 283. \\nThe nourishment requisite for vegetables, is not \\nall derived from the soil in which they are plant- \\ned, the greatest quantity being obtained from the \\natmosphere. Shrubs, trees, and succulent plants, \\nin particular, receive most of their sustenance from \\nthe air : dew, mist, and rain, are also rapidly ab- \\nsorbed by them. The secondary vessels {§ 241), \\nproperly perform this function, so do all fine capil- \\nlary elongations. Thus the green stalk, and the un- \\nder surface of the leaves, chiefly absorb these moist \\nvapours. \\nJBonnet demonstrated this last fact by a beautiful \\nexperiment. He placed a leaf of the white mulberry \\ntree, (^Morus alba J, with its upper surface upon wa- \\nter, and it continued six days fresh and green. A \\nleaf of the same tree, which was laid with its under \\nsurface upon water, remained for six months fresh, \\nand in good condition. \\nPlants imbibe gases also, otherwise it would be \\nimpossible to explain whence they derive the great \\nquantity of carbon, of which they principally con- \\nsist. \\n\\n324 \\nPKINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\n§ 284. \\nThe function of transpiration is performed by \\nplants through apertures which are surrounded by \\nthe lymphatic vessels. Bonnet anointed leaves with \\noil, by which means the process of transpiration \\nwas completely suppressed. They assumed a black \\ncolour, and decayed. I observed the same thing \\nin a hot-house plant, the leaves of which being oiled \\nin order to destroy the aphides, all fell off. Plants \\nwhich have been exposed to the dust, by the conti- \\nnuance of drought, lose the leaves, merely because \\ntheir pores are obstructed. \\nThe number of the pores which are found on \\nthe whole surface of a plant, is by no means insigni- \\nficant. Hedwig enumerated five hundred and seven- \\nty seven in one single quadrate line, on the surface \\nof a leaf of the Lilium bidbif \\'ernm. Thus, accord- \\ning to this computation, a square foot would have \\nnine hundred ninety eight thousand, seven hundred \\nand forty-five. How many square feet of surface \\nmust a plant present to the air, and how great must \\nbe their number in a full grown oak ! ! \\nThe transpiration of plants is twofold, aqueous \\nand gaseous. The aqueous is considerable ; Hales \\nmade many experiments, which clearly prove this \\nassertion. A plant 3 feet high, lost in one hour, \\n1 lb. and 6 oz during the night : if no dew fell \\nit sustained a loss of six ounces ; but if dew fell, the \\nleaves had imbibed 4 or 6 ounces of moisture; \\nwhereas in the day time, the transpiration was al- \\n\\nfllYSlOLOGT. \\n325 \\nways very considerable. Watson exposed a glass of 20 \\nsquare inches Avithin, fo very warm sunshine, in a \\nplace where it had not rained for several months, \\nand turning it round upon a plot of mowed grass, he \\nfound it full of drops of water, which ran copiously \\ndown ; he collected them by an exactly weighed \\npiece of muslin, and repeated this experiment for \\nseveral days, between 12 and 3 o\\'clock; hence he \\nwas enabled to calculate that an acre of ground \\ntranspires in 24 hours, 5400 quarts of water. Brug- \\nmanns observed a particular kind of aqueous trans- \\npiration in the roots of some luxuriant plants ; he \\nhad put some plants of this kind into a glass filled \\nwitii earth, and observed at night a drop of fluid \\nin the top of the radicles ; he remarked as soon as \\nsuch a drop touched the roots of other plants, they \\ndried immediately. If this happened frequently, \\nthe plant decayed. \\nThus Oats, (Avena sativa J, were destroyed in this \\nmanner by Serratula drvensis. \\nFlax, (Linum nsitatissimum), by the Scabiosa ar- \\n%\\'ensis and Euphorbia Pep/us: \\nWheat, (Triticum acstivum), by Erigcron acre. \\nBuck-\\\\\\\\lieat, (Polygonum Fago\\'pijrum), by Sper- \\n(Tula artensis. \\nCarrots, (Daucus CaroiaJ by the Inula. IIek?ii urn. \\nHence he concludes, that weeds with the fluid drop- \\nping from their radicles, suppress the growth of the \\ncontiguous plants. But might not the weed destroy \\nthe cultivated plant, owing to ils absorbing the ali- \\nmentary matter Avith greater rapidity, and expand - \\nX 2 \\n\\n326 \\nPRINCirLESOF BOTANY, ETC \\niiig sooner, luul tlius prevent the further growth of \\nthe adjacent plant ? \\nDrops are also frequently observed on the leaves \\nof quick growing plants, particularly on the top. \\nThe gaseous transpiration of plants was first ob- \\nserved by Bonnet in 1754, after him by Priestley in \\n1773, and next by Ingenhouss 1779, afterwards by \\nother celebrated philosophers, Sennebier, Scheele, \\nAchard, Scherer, Succou, &c. &c. No branch of \\nthe physiology of plants has produced more nume- \\nrous experiments. The following are the results of \\nall these laborious investigations : Plants in sun-shine \\nemit a great quantity of oxygen gas, but at night ex- \\nhale a kind of air which is unfavourable to animal \\nrespiration. The quantity of this, however, is much \\nless than that of the oxygen lost in the day time. \\nThus a constant circulation takes place in the at- \\nmosphere, the plants improving the air which has \\nbeen spoiled by the breathing of animals. \\nThe surface of leaves, all green stalks, and in ge- \\nneral the green part of vegetables, exhale oxygen \\ngas in sun-shine, but particularly green water plants, \\npine trees, gramina and many succulent plants. \\nThe leaves of trees emit less of it than herbs. No • \\noxygen gas whatever, even when exposed to the sun, \\nis emitted from Ilex aqidfolhmi ; Prunus laurocera- \\nsus ; Mimosa sensitim, Acer foliis variegatis, the \\npetala, ripe fruits, the bark of trees, the pedicles and \\nthe ribs of leaves. The gas which is emitted during \\no \\nnight is by far less in quantity, either pure carbonic \\nacid gas, or, as in most cases, often mixed with hy- \\ndrogen, sometinaes also with azot€r \\n\\nPIIVSIOLOGY. \\n327 \\n{ 285. \\nWater is the chief nourishment of plants. They \\nabsorb it out of the earth by theh\\' roots, and above \\nthe earth they imbibe all the moisture which exists \\nin the form of vapour. The light by its stimulus \\nresolves water into its constituents, hydrogen and \\noxygen. The oxygen combines with the caloric, \\nbecomes gaseous, and conducted by the air vessels \\nruns out from the pores of the leaves. The hy- \\ndrogen combines with carbon which plants like- \\nwise absorb, and with several elements which the \\nvegetable body receives in various proportions, ac- \\ncording to its organization, and forms the juices and \\nother substances peculiar to vegetables. \\nAt night, when the light cannot effect the decom- \\nposition of water, combinations and separations of \\nanother kind take place, and for this reason plants \\nthen discharge carbonic acid and azotic gases. The \\nlittle oxygen which remains cannot stimulate the fibre \\nso powerfully, consequently the quantity of transpired \\nmatter is much less. The stimulus which the oxy- \\ngen, separated by the light, has exerted upon the \\nfibre, occasions a relaxation, by which the sleep of \\nplants, or folding of the leaves is produced. Light \\nis absolutely necessary to plants, as it nourishes them \\nby means of its influence. If we except subterra- \\nneous plants, and some species of Boletus, the ve- \\ngetation of which is regulated by other principles \\nhitherto not investigated, vegetables cannot exist with- \\nout the influence of light. The direction, and pro- \\nX 3 \\n\\n328 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANV, ETC. \\nper situation of the parts in every species depend en- \\ntirely upon it. \\nPlants also, which aftect the shade require \\nlight, but that only in a moderate quantity; the \\nrays of the sun uould stimulate them too vio- \\nlently. \\nYoung plants as well as most of the Cryptoganious \\nclass, require defence against too powerful light, but \\ncannot live without its influence. \\nTrees and the most of the gramina need a great \\ndeal of h<j;ht, and hence all trees have a greater ten- \\ndency towards the south than towards the north. \\nIt is by the decomposition of water that the tem- \\nperature peculiar to plants is produced {§ 23.5.) Phi- \\nlosophers, however, are not entirely agreed in their \\nexplanations of this phenomenon. Sennebier and \\nHassentratz assert that the oxygen, being set free \\nby the decomposition of water, unites with the calo- \\nric of the vegetable fibre, and flows in a gaseous \\nform from the pores of the vessels. Von Humboldt \\nagain supposes that plants absorb caloric from the \\natmosphere, and combine in the air with the oxygen, \\nwhicii is separated by the influence of light. He be- \\nlieves that in this manner the coolina; shade of trees \\nmay be accounted for. \\nThe functions of absorption \\'and exhalation ap- \\npear to take place in mushrooms according to their \\nprinci})les. This, however, needs to be confirmed \\nby future observations. Agaricus campcstris, and \\nAndrosaceiis, continually exhale hydrogen. Oxygen \\nappears to be a stimulus to them, as the most of \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. 529 \\nthem when immersed in hydrogen and azotic gas are \\nsoon destroyed. \\n§ 286. \\nHow the matters which are absorbed by plants are \\nassimilated, that is, are combined into the juices \\npeculiar to the vegetable world, is a mystery to us. \\nIn none of the organised bodies have we hitherto \\nbeen able to explain this assimilation, though there \\nhas been no want of theories upon the subject. \\nSome account for this beautiful operation by mere \\ncontraction of the parts ; others by the form of the \\nactive organs ; others again by the form of the sub- \\nstances ; but these are all very unsatisfactory hypo- \\ntheses. This much, in the mean time, appears cer- \\ntain, that the proportion of the parts, as well as the \\nformation and direction of the organs, and the great- \\ner or less irritability arising from them, may produce \\nthe various mixtures. But how comes it to pass, \\nthat every part of a plant frequently differs in taste \\nand in smell? Thus the root of the Mimosa Nilotica \\nsmells like assafoetida, but the Howcr emits a very \\nagreeable odour. The stem exudes the bland well \\nknown gum arable, and the juices which it contains \\nare .sour and astringent. \\nIt would appear that plants first form out of the \\nelements, the constituents which are found in them, \\nand do not obtain them in such a state from the earth. \\nEven the earth and metals which are found in them \\nappear to be originally formed out of the elements \\nby the power of the organs. Schrader has made \\nsome very interesting experiments on this subject, \\nX 4 \\n\\n550 \\nphinciples of botanv, etc \\nHe sowed in sublimated sulphur several species of \\ncom, sprinkled them with distilled water, and pre- \\nvented dust or any other foreign body from approach- \\ning them ; ■ in this way no earth could come upon \\nthem; and yet these species of corn had the same \\nconstituents, the same kinds of earth, and metal, \\nviz. iron and manganese, that are found in the \\nculm and ears of those which grow in the usual \\nmanner *. \\nSome philosophers maintain, that plants imbibe \\nfrom the ground earthy, saline, mucilaginous and oily \\nsubstances, and again deposit them. They there- \\nfore imagine that manure gives to vegetables the con- \\nstituent parts, and that on this account plants grow \\nup in it with greater beauty and rapidity. But plants \\ndo not deposit crude juices, which have not been \\nwrought in the cellular texture {§ 241), on the con- \\ntrary, all the fluids are completely formed. Were \\nthe case otherwise, a great quantity of Ammonia, \\nPhosphorus and other constituents discovered in ani- \\nmal excrements, would be found in plants reared in \\ndung. Now in corn growing m a soil, either plen- \\ntifully manured or not manured at all, a greater or \\nless quantity of these constituents is never observed. \\n* I need here only advert to the experiments made on young \\nchickens which are gently withdrawn from the egg, and as yet \\nreceive no nourishment. It is found that the chicken contains \\nfive times more lime than the egg before being hatched. In \\nthis case the lime must be formed first out of the elements by \\norganised power, or is any other way imaginable by which it \\ncould find its way into tlie young animal ? \\n\\npiiysioi.oGV, \\nManure operates only as a stimulus on the fibre \\nof vegetables, so that they are enabled to absorb \\ncarbon the more rapidly, and ail the constituents are \\nfirst composed. This is particularly evident from \\nthe above related* experiments {§ 278), where del- \\nved earth, saturated with oxygen, as well as ground \\nsprinkled with diluted sulphuric acid, made plants \\ngrow more rapidly, than a great deal of manure laid \\nupon the earth, \\n§ 287. \\nThe vessels appear particularly to prepare the jui- \\nces, as fluids have been found completely prepared \\nin the cellular texture of the root. It seems, how- \\never, as if the receptacle of the manures in the cel- \\nlular texture concentrated them still more; and that \\nthis also contributes its effect to their preparation. \\nThus as glands prepare in general oily, seldom mu- \\ncilaginous fluids, a great quantity of glands is there- \\nfore found in the leaves of all fragrant plants. \\nSometimes this oil abounds so plentifully in the \\nglands that it may be separated from them by mere \\npressure ; as in the rind of Citrus medica, Aurantium, \\n&c. and in the leaves of Melaleuca Leucodendron. \\nVessels which are still young, are the most active \\nin plants. As soon as they begin to pass into albur- \\nnum or wood, the circulation of their fluids is in a \\nsensible degree slower. \\nThus the chief seat of life, particularly in ligneous \\nplants, is to be sought for in the inner bark. Hence \\ntrees become strong and large when they receive no \\nexternal wound on the stem, so as to injure the in- \\n\\n332 \\nPRINCIPIES OF BOTANV, ETC. \\nner bark. Trees, the bark of wliich was frozen in \\nsevere winters, will decay, whereas those which lose \\ntheir pith by cold, without their inner bark being af- \\nfected, may continue to grow without sustaining any \\ninjury. \\nWhere the layer of the inner bark, which as we \\nknow is composed of vessels, is thinnest, the growth \\nis most rapid, and leaves are also formed. For this \\nreason, thin branches are provided only with leaves. \\nThe inner bark begins in the alburnum, i. e. there \\nare new vessels situated in the alburnum, which as \\nlong as they form a thin delicate layer easily sepa- \\nrable, are called inner bark. This layer, however, \\nhardens into alburnum, and at last into wood. Du \\nHamel saw no connection betw-een the cortex and \\nwood of a willow tree. He found, however, a mois- \\nture, which in the air became mucilaginous and te- \\nnacious ; this he with Grew called Cambium. He \\nalledgcs that it is the formative organ in plants. He \\ntook away from a cherry tree in full bloom all its \\ncortex longitudinally, and covered it closely with a \\nlayer of straw ; many of the leaves fell off, some of \\nthe branches withered, and no fruit was produced. \\nThe tree continued diseased next year, but in the \\nthird summer, it again acquired bark. \\nHad the young w ood, deprived of the stem which \\nis full of moisture, and which had lately, for the \\nfirst time, formed the new layer of inner bark, not \\nbeen preserved from the access of the air, the juice \\nwould have dried up, and the tree been destroyed ; but \\nthe covering of straw inclosed it as well as the cortexy \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n533 \\nmid it again formed the same layer of inner bark with \\nthe cortex. \\nThe hardened fibres of vegetables, comprehended \\nunder the general name of wood, have, however, dif- \\nferent degrees of hardness in proportion as they con- \\nfine carbon by the power of their organization, and \\nthe harder the w ood proves, the slower is the growth \\nof tlie tree or shrub. The firmest and hardest woods \\nhave, therefore, the most carbon, and require a long \\ntime for their perfect vegetation ; as, the white \\nbeech, (Carpinus BctulusJ, the red beech, (Fagus^z//- \\nvatica), the oak (Quercus Robur and Peduncuiata), \\nthe cedar of Lebanon, (Pinus Cedrus), Adansonia \\ndigifata, &c. &c. There are, however, exceptions \\nto this rule, as Robinia Pseudacacia, which grows \\nvery fast, and has firm hard wood. \\nEvery shrub or tree with us, forms annually two \\nshoots, the one, which is the chief shoot, evolves in \\nspring, the other is not so strong, and appears to- \\nwards the longest day, about St Johns\\' day, from \\nwhich it has been called St John\\'s shoot. The first \\nis formed from the quantity of juices which the \\nroot has imbibed daring winter. The second, from \\nthe moisture imbibed during the spring. In the \\ntorrid zone, both shoots are equally strong, and \\nhence plants there grow much more luxuriantly. \\n<^ 288. \\nThe green colour of the vegetable creation is a \\nmost refreshing sight. The investigation of its cause \\nhas long occupied the attention of philosophers, and \\ngiven rise to many hypotheses, When phlogistoa \\n\\n334 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC \\nStill had a number of adherents, the explanation of \\nthe green colour was very easy, as it was considered \\nas an eff(3ct of this principle. Since, however, the \\nidea of its existence has been given up, different \\nkinds of explanation have been devised. Rerthollet \\nobserved, that the green of plants is not composed \\nof blue and yellow, as the prism does not analize \\ntheir green, like that of other bodies, into yellow and \\nblue rays. \\nAfter extracting with alcohol the green colour \\nfrom the leaves, and exposing this mixture to the \\nsun or atmosphere, the green colour disappears en- \\ntirely. The oxygen ,of the atmosphere combines \\nwith the mixture, and banishes the colour. If a so- \\nlution of ammonia, which consists of hydrogen and \\nazote, be dropped into it, the latter separates the \\noxygen from the mixture, and the green colour is re- \\nstored to it. From all the observations on this point \\nit follows, that leaves, from which the oxygen has \\nbeen withdrawn by means of light, are green, but \\nhave a pale or whitish colour where the oxygen is \\naccumulated. The mixture of hydrogen and carbon \\nis now considered by chemists as the cause of the \\ngreen vegetable colour. \\n§ 289. \\nThe dark colour of the cortex in M^oody plants is, \\naccording to Berthollet\\'s observations, produced by \\nthe oxygen of the atmosphere. Mr Humboldt re- \\npeated his experiments, and found that wood, when \\nenclosed in oxygen gas, became black in two or \\nthree days, and the gas was mixed with carbon. It \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n335 \\nappears from this, that the oxygen of the atmos- \\nphere combines ^vith the hydrogen of the vegetable \\nfibre, and sets the carbon free, which shows its par- \\nticular black colour. \\n§ 290. \\nThe leaves of plants are of various duration. \\nMost of them in warm climates remain from three to \\nsix years on the branches. A few in colder climates, \\nand only those which have a tenacious sap, as Ilex \\naquifoUum and Viscum album, or such, which have \\nsap of a resinous nature, as all the pine-tribe trees, \\nretain their leaves during winter. All other plants \\nof the colder climates drop their leaves in autumn. \\nThis happens in many different ways. Some leaves \\ndecay gradually, and fall off, or remain on the stem \\nin a dry state till spring ; others fall off when still \\ngreen, even in the mild, serene days of autumn. In \\nquite a different manner the Robinia Pseudacacia \\nparts with its leaves. The pinnate leaves of this tree \\nfirst drop, then ail the pinnulae, and at last, after \\nthem, the petiole to which they adhered drops o?l. \\nVarious reasons have been given why plants lose \\ntheir leaves in autumn ; the principal opinions of \\nphilosophers on this subject are the following : \\nDu Hamel formed two hypotheses about this phe- \\nnomenon. He assumed, in the first, a herbaceous \\npart in the petiole, at the spot where its notch is, \\nwhich in cold autunmal nights is injured, and produ- \\nces the falling off of the leaves. \\nHe abandoned, however, this opinion, because he \\nsaw leaves drop off in warm autumnal days, without \\n\\n3S0 \\nPRI.VCrPLES OF BOTANY, ETC \\nany preceding cold, and then devised the following \\nexplanation. The moisture, which is conveyed by \\nthe root, favours the growth of the petiole, the great \\ntranspiration of the leaves renders it at last quite \\ndry, and therefore the leaves fall off, because the \\npetiole has lost all its sap. \\nMr IHIuste} tliought that the leaves transpire less \\nduring autumn. Hence the sap is accumulated in \\nthem, which produces a transverse fissure at their \\nbasis. The leaves, therefore, must separate from \\nthe petiole, and drop off* \\nVrolick supposes that leaves possess a peculiar \\nlife, in which various periods may be perceived. \\nTheir life, however, depends entirely on the life of \\nthe plant. When they fall off, they have come to \\ntheir greatest age, and the plant can exist for some \\ntime without them. The dead leaves separate from \\nthe living part, like dead parts in the animal eco- \\nnomy from sound ones. \\nWere the opinions of Du Ilamel and Mustel \\nfounded in truth, the leaves would never fall off in \\n■warm climates. But there are in the East Indies \\nsome trees which, at the rainy season, drop all their \\nleaves, and, like our trees, are perfectly leafless. \\nMr Thunberg likewise saw at Java an oak tree \\nwhich lost its leaves at the same time as in Europe. \\nThere must, therefore, be another cause of this phe- \\nnomenon. Vrolick\\'s opinion is just, and perfectly \\ncorresponds with all observations. \\nThe true cause of the falling off of the leaves is \\nthis: During the summer, the vessels of the petiole \\nbecome gradually ligneous, as the sap is conveyed \\n\\nniYSlOLOGT. \\nto them in greater quantity, and the whole frame of \\nthe leaves gets a more ligneous consistence. The \\nsap must in consequence gradually stagnate, and at \\nlast the communicatinii substances between the stem \\nand the petiole are completely shrunk. The wound \\nwhich the stem thus receives cicatrises before the \\npetiole separates. The connexion now interrupted \\nbetween the leaf and the stem, and their vessels, \\ncauses the petiole, by which they are connected, to \\nseparate entirely, and thus, especially in calm serene \\nweather, the leaves unavoidably fall off. For as the \\nrays of the sun still favour the last decomposition of \\nthe water, and the reducent vessels cannot convey \\nthe small quantity of moisture to the knot of the \\npetiole, the motion of the small quantity of sap \\nnaturally remaining will cause some sort of concus- \\nsion, which is sufficient to occasion the fall of the \\nleaf. \\nIn the oak-tree the leaf cannot fall off in autumn, \\nas the vascular fibre of this tree is very tenacious, \\nand on this account the connexion between the knot \\nof the petiole and the stem is not broken. In the \\nRobinia Psendacacia the small and tender petioles of \\nthe leaves first are closed up, and separate of course \\nearlier from the common petiole, which is still suc- \\nculent enough to remain a short time, but soon, \\nas without the leaves it cannot subsist, has the same \\nfate. It depends, therefore, entirely on the nature \\nof the leaf, how long it is to remain on the stem, and \\nby no means on the weather. The peculiar organi- \\nzation must not be overlooked, as it rcallv has a \\npowerful influence. \\n\\n338 PltlNClPLES OF BOTANY, ETC* \\n§ 291. \\nThe growth of the plant ends with the evolutioa \\nof the flower. When a plant has acquired a certain \\ndegree of firmness, (which, as they are so multifari- \\nous, docs not happen in each at the same time, or \\nin the same age), it then becomes capable of propa- \\ngating its own species, and that part which we call \\nthe flower, is now formed. Its speedy appearance \\nin herbaceous plants, may generally be observed \\nfrom the circumstance, that the minute scaly leaves \\ngrow gradually less^ till the smaller and more deli- \\ncate parts of the flower are at last unfolded. Goethe \\nis therefore not mistaken, when he calls the growth \\nof plants a contraction and expansion ; an idea \\nwhich Wolfe already has endeavoured to prove. \\n§ 292. \\nThe flower is, as all the other parts of plants, \\nformed by spiral vessels, which, as soon as the first \\nrude sketch, as it w^ere, of the flower exists, are \\nalready observable. Linn6 formed a very erroneous \\nidea of this subject. He considered the pith of a \\nplant, which he believed to be of equal importance \\nwith the spinal marrow of animals, as the sole \\nformative organ in the whole vegetable kingdom. \\nVegetation in general, according to his opinion, \\nwent on by means of the pith. The seed itself was a \\nsmall piece of pith, which separated from the mother \\nplant, on purpose to go through the same revolur \\ntions as the old plant had done. But he proceeded \\nstill farther, and ascribed to each part of a plant a j \\n\\nPHVSIOLOGV. \\n337 \\noertain peculiar power in forming one part of the \\nllower. The calyx was formed by the bark, the co- \\nrolla by the inner bark ; the stamens were formed \\nby the wood, and the pistils by the pith. He car- \\nried this ingenious hypothesis still further, by assert- \\ning, that in ligneous plants each branch required five \\nyears for the final evolution of the flower, and that \\neach 3\\'ear something was added to the future flower. \\nIn the first year, for instance, the scales (squamae) \\nare formed, when the branch is shooting out from \\nthe bud ; in the second year the calyx ; the corolla \\nin the third ; in the fourth the stamens ; and in the \\nfifth the whole, for the formation of which nature \\nrequired all that time, is completely evolved. \\nLinnaeus may be right so far, that plants require \\na certain time to blossom ; that in them previously a \\ngreat quantity of sap, which has been so carefully \\nelaborated, as to become capable of forming parts \\nso important for the continuation of the species, is \\nfirst laid up; but that every year any one part of \\nthe flower, as an effort, is produced, would be \\nvery difficult to prove. As little can we suppose \\nthat the pith alone is the only formative part in \\nplants. It is clear from the account of its use and \\ndesign, (§ 272), that it may be wanted, which is con- \\ntrary to the old opinion: But that the cortex, inner \\nbark, wood, and pith, &c. should each form a \\npeculiar part of the plant, is so much against com- \\nmon experience, that it is hardly necessary to refute \\nit. We find in ttie springing flower, elongations of \\nspiral vessels, but we never see elongations from \\neach particular part, one forming the future calyx \\ny \\n\\n338 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANr, ETC. \\nanother the corolla, and so forth. For instance, in \\nthe common sun-flower, (Helianthus annuus), where \\non a large receptacle, numerous small flowers arc \\nplaced, how should those elongations be able to un- \\nfold themselves into florets from the bark, inner \\nbark, &c. through such a receptacle? There would \\narise a confusion amongst those small parts which is \\nnever met with. Further, how should the stamina \\nbe produced in herbs, which are not ligneous, or the \\npistil, in plants which have no pith ? Who does not \\nsee that all these assertions are mere hypotheses, \\nwhich may be refuted, even without the aid of \\nanatomical investigation ? \\nThe flower does not always appear in the angles \\nof the leaves or at the extremities of the stem, but \\nin some plants it shoots forth in very uncommon \\nplaces. \\nRohria petioliflora has its flowers situated on the \\npetiole. This is also the case in Salsola altissmOy \\nand some other plants. In most species of the ge- \\nnus Ruscus, the flower is found in the middle of the \\nleaf. Most species of Phyllanthus, Xylophylla, Po- \\nlycardia, and one species of Ruscus, R. androgynuSy \\nflower on the margin of the leaves. On branches \\nwhich are leafless appear the flowers of Cynometra \\nramijiora ; Ceratonia Siliqua ; Averrhoa Bilimbi, and \\nA. Cara7iibola, Boehmeria ramijiora, and other plants. \\nMost remarkable is the station of the flower in a \\ntree of the East Indies, called Cynometra caulifora. \\nThis very leafy tree has no flowers, but at the foot \\nof its stem; its leafy top never produces any. \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY-. 339 \\n§ 293. \\nThe flower, (J 71)* consists of the calyx, corolla \\nnectary, stamens, and pistils. \\nThe calyx and corolla are, in point of the distribu- \\ntion of their vessels, exactly like the leaves. The \\ncalyx, when green, transpires, like the leaves, oxygen \\ngas in sunshine ; but when it is coloured this does \\nnot take place. Both these parts imbibe their ne- \\ncessary support from the air and convey it to the re- \\nceptacle on which the flower is placed. \\nThe functions of absorption and transpiration are \\nperformed by the leafy parts of the flower as well as \\nby the leaves of the plants. Only the coloured \\nflower emits other gases. Hitherto it has not been \\ndetermined, whether the phenomenon which the \\nDictamnus albns presents in warm serene summer \\nnights, when there is no moonshine, is produced by \\nhydrogen gas, or by the transpiration of a fine vo- \\nlatile oil. If this blooming plant is in abundance, \\nand about this time is moved suddenly through an \\nextended space, and if immediately adjoining there \\nbe a piece of burning paper, a fine blue flame which \\nmay be easily extinguished, is instantly emitted. The \\ndaughter of Linnaeus observed in the Tropaeolum \\nmajusy and other flowers of a deep orange colour, an \\nelectric spark, during the dark and serene warm \\nsummer evenings. The nectaries, 86) when they \\ndo not consist of mere glands, agree in structure with \\nthe corolla. \\ny 2 \\n\\n340 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\n§ 294. \\nThe stamens {§ gO), consist of the filament and \\nanther. They are likewise called the male organs \\nof generation. The filament, in the distribution of its \\nvessels, sometimes resembles the herbaceous stem, \\nsometimes the leaves, according to the variety of its \\nshape, which differs very much, but in each plant \\ncommonly bears a peculiar and constant character. \\nThe anthers are formed of a thin but vascular mem- \\nbrane, filled with pollen. \\nThe pollen occurs under a variety of forms, which \\ncan be seen only with a microscope. Jussieu, Du \\nHamel, Needham, Gleichen, and others, observed \\nwith a high magnifying microscope, that the grains \\nof the pollen, when brought in contact with water, \\nburst with a degree of violence, and emit a gelati- \\nnous mas?. Koelreuter, on the contrary, assures us, \\nthat ripe pollen does not buret suddenly when wetted, \\nbut slowly emits through its pores, or, if provided \\nwith small prickles, through those an oily fluid, which \\non the surface of water forms a distinct shining pel- \\nlicle. He says further, that each single granule of \\nthe pollen consists of two membranes ; an external I \\none, which is thick, elastic, cartilaginous, and full of I \\nTery delicate vessels, in which last are the pores i \\nwhich emit the oily liquid, and secondly an internal i \\nvery fine membrane. The internal surface is lined I \\nwith very tender, elastic, cellular texture, which con- \\ntains the oily impregnating mass. Hedwig, however, \\nafter his latest researches, does not agree with Koel- \\nreuter. He says, that each j^ranule of the pollen \\n\\ni»HYSlOL0OY. \\n541 \\nconsists of one vascular membrane only, filled in its \\ninterior with a gelatinous mass, but has no cellular \\ntexture whatever. And, according to him, the pol- \\nlen emits this fluid at once ; it does not exude out \\nthrough pores. Hedwig examined that portion of \\npollen, which had on the female stigma performed \\nits functions, and he found this observation confirm- \\ned. Even the stamens of the mosses are, according \\nto him, only granules of pollen acting as the others. \\nHe finds a great similarity between this fructifying \\nmass and the semen of animals ; only, that as well as \\nin the animal kingdom, it differs in consistence in \\ndifferent species. Most observations indeed coin- \\ncide in this, that the moisture which is contained in^ \\nthe pollen, is not oil, but a mere gelatinous mass, \\nwhich, however, cannot easily be mixed with water. \\nIt is, however, likewise proved by experience, \\nthat this mucus contains a considerable quantity \\nof oil, for an oil may be obtained from the pollen by \\npressure, as it takes fire when thrown into a flame, \\nand finally, bees prepare their wax from it. It does \\nnot however follow, that the whole is oily ; for an \\nalmond cannot be called merely an oily substance \\nbecause oil may be obtained from it; it contains this \\noil in a gelatinous mass. \\nAs in the animal kingdom, a more important \\nquestion, what constitutes the impregnating power \\nof the pollen, or on what does it depend? remains \\nstill unanswered. Is it a subtile oily vapour, or a \\nsubtile volatile aura? or is it, according to others, \\nelectricity, or any other {)0wer ? Still we are here in^ \\nthe dark. \\nV 3 \\n\\n342 \\nPRIXCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\n§ 295. \\n^- The female organs of fructification are the pistil, \\ni)4), which consists of the germen, the style, and \\nthe stigma. The germen varies in its shape and \\nstructure in various plants. It is composed of all \\nthose vessels which we noticed in the rest of the \\nplant ; their direction and distribution only differ \\nin each. The seeds, if the germen itself does not \\nbecome a seed, are situated in it, and are connected \\nwith it by the umbilical cord, (§ ll6.) In its interior, \\nit contains a clear fluid, in which nothing particular \\ncan be perceived. When the germen is converted \\ninto a seed, the umbilical cord hangs together with the \\nreceptacle, and is very short. The internal structure \\nof such a germen, is the same as that of the seed \\nwhich is contained in the germen. \\nThe style appears under a great variety \\nof shapes. All the known vegetable vessels com- \\npose it, and it has hollow tubes, which at the top \\nare, by a tender cellular texture, connected with the \\nsurface of the germen, and with the cord of the \\nseed. \\nHedwig, in his microscopical researches, found in \\nthe species of gourd, (cucurhita) and its kindred \\nplants, on the stigma, hollow channels, in which he \\ndetected a firm, yellow, gelatinous body, which in the \\ngourd was quadrangular, ran through the whole ex- \\ntent of the style, and ended in the umbilical cord of \\nthe seed. It appeared impenetrable, and incapable \\nof carrying any fluid. But as, unquestionably, it \\ncontributes to the fecundation of the pollen, either \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n343 \\nas a conductor or as a conveying medium, he calls it \\nconductor fructificatmiis. Its use, however, is yet \\nconcealed from us ; and it is even not yet precisely \\nascertained, whether other plants have it, or if a \\ndifferent regulation in them answers the same \\npurpose. \\nThe stigma consists of hollow absorbent channels, \\nthe structure of which is observable only with the \\nmicroscope. Those absorbent channels or tubes \\nconstitute the stigma. What the Terminology calls \\nstigma, (if 97,) is not always stigma, and sometimes \\na very small part of it ; at other times, the whole \\nstyle is stigma. \\nThe pappus, which is met with in compound \\nDowers, Q 117), and which exists completely form- \\ned in the ripe seeds, is certainly not to be consider- \\ned, with Rafn, as a mere inorganic lifeless fibre. \\nTo me, it appears to consist of large elongations of \\nthe secondary vessels, which contribute a great deal \\nto the condensation and proper preparation of the \\nsap. They, indeed, grow themselves at the very \\nperiod they perform these functions ; when, there- \\nfore the seed has attained its proper size, the vessels \\nof the pappus become plugged up, and it remains \\ndry upon the seed. \\nThe stigma, now in its state of puberty, or M^ien \\nfit for impregnation, is covered with a fluid, which \\nKoelreuter likewise considers as oily, but the nature \\nof which is yet not investigated. The period when \\nthe stigma is moist and the anthers burst, is the \\n\\n344 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTAXY, ETC. \\nperiod of impregnation. This copulation, however, \\nis in plants performed in so very striking a manner, \\nthat we cannot conten»plate without admiration the \\nwise measures which nature has taken for the ac- \\ncomplishment of her designs. Most flowers are \\nhermaphrodite, or such as have both male and fe- \\nmale organs of generation ; and one would from this \\ncircumstance be led to believe, that in such flowers \\nimpregnation is readily completed ; this however is \\nnot the case with all. \\nMr Sprengel has made many observations on this \\npoint, most of which are highly important. lie \\ndiscovered two principal ways in which seeds are \\nimpregnated, to wit, Dichogamy, {Dichogamia)y \\nand Homogamy, ( Homogamia). He calls it Dich- \\nogamy, svlien in a hermaphrodite flower one organ \\nof generation is first evolved, and when this has lost \\nits generative power, the other organ arrives at per- \\nfection. This is again of a twofold kind. Either the \\nmale parts are formed perfectly, before the female \\nparts unfold themselves, which he calls Dichogamia \\nandrogyna ; or it is the reverse, the female parts be- \\ning first formed. This he styles Dichogamia gynan- \\ndra. Homogamy is, when both parts of generation \\nare formed in a hermaphrodite flower, exactly at \\nthe same period. \\nNow, in a hermaphrodite flower, when Dichoga- \\nmy takes place, impregnation cannot naturally hap- \\npen without interiDediate means, by which both \\norgans of generation may be brought near each \\nother. Linn^ thought that the wiixl performed this, \\nbut there are few plants where wind could do it, as \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGr. \\n345 \\nmost flowers have such a shape as would rather im- \\npede than favour the access of the Avind. Koel- \\nreuter was the first wlio observed clearly that many \\ninsects serve this purpose, and Mr Sprengel had \\nleisure and patience enough to examine in the flower \\nthe manner in which insects proceed in completing \\nthe impregnation of plants. \\nHe found that various species of bees, as well as \\nmany of the flying insects, are selected by nature \\nfor this purpose ; and he even observed, that some \\nflowers had their peculiar insects, which alone vi- \\nsited them. His observations on this subject arc \\nvery numerous. Those insects, it is true, do not \\nvisit the flower on purpose to impregnate it, they \\nonly seek after the sweet juice which exudes from it \\nin their nectaries. Their hairy body, which nature did \\nnot bestow without design, is covered with the pollen, \\nand, whenever they visit another flower of the same \\nspecies, the pollen is rubbed against the stigma, and \\nimpregnation is the consequence. And every insect \\nthat is not limited to one sort of flower, but visits \\nmany indiscriminately, will, during a whole day, re- \\nmain with the species on which it first fixed in the \\nmorning, and not touch another, provided there be \\nenough of the first species. \\nThose flowers only w^iich secrete a sweet juice, \\nare visited by insects. Several of these flowers \\nhave one or more coloured spots, which Mr Sprengel \\ncalls Maculae indicantes, as they always indicate \\nthat a i)lant exudes honey, and, as he believes, \\nattracts them. In flowers the hairs are always \\nplaced so as to prevent the rain fi\\'lJln dropping \\n\\n346 \\nPiUNCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nin, and not to allow the insect to enter the flower \\nat that place, on purpose that it may be obliged \\nto make its way across the stamens. The filiform \\nand leaf- like appendages, Mhich we enum.erated \\namongst the parts of flowers, 89 J, and which \\ndefend the honey, serve the same purpose. But it \\nwould be too prolix to give a more detailed account \\nof the manner in which insects do this, as any one \\nhas access to see and observe this, if in the least ac- \\nquainted with the structure of flowers. We need \\nonly look at the Iris germanica, at many flowers of \\ntlie class Didynamia, at the Symphytum ojjicinaky \\nand many other plants, in order to form a clear idea \\nof it. One of the most singular ways of the \\nfecundatiyi of plants through insects, we have in \\nthe Aristolochia Ckmatitis, which I shall describe. \\nFig. 271 represents this flower on a small scale ; \\nit has a linguiform corol, which at its inferior part is \\nspherical, towards the top it becomes long and ta- \\nbular, and its margins end in a flat and spear-point- \\ned manner. The pistil is placed in the round cavi- \\nty of the corol, the gcrmen of which is surrounded \\nby six anthers, w hich are shorter than the germen \\nitself. The germen has no style, but is provided \\nwith a hexagonal stigma, which is very shallow, and \\non its upper surface has imbibing pores. The anther \\ncannot empty the pollen upon the stigma, as the \\nflower stands always straight upright during the \\nperiod of flowering. The pollen therefore must ne- \\ncessarily fall to the bottom of the flower without \\nbeing used, if no insects come near the flower. \\nAnd indeed -1. it be tried, and all insects kept from \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGy, \\n347 \\nthe flower by a thin, but firmly closed piece of \\ngauze, no seeds will be formed. It happens indeed \\nnot unfrequently, that as it is a particular insect \\nwhich impregnates the flowers, when it is want- \\ning or not able to find the flower, this last withers \\nwithout having a single seed. This insect is the \\nTipula pennkornis. The round bottom of the flow- \\ner is, in its interior, quite smooth, but the tube is \\nlined with dense hair, every one of which is turned \\ntowards the interior, so as to form a kind of funnel, \\nthrough which the insect may very easily enter, but \\nas on its return all the hairs oppose it, it cannot come \\nout. Several insects creep in through the aperture, \\nbut are obli2;ed to remain in the cavitv of the corol- \\nla. Uneasy to be confined in so small a space, they \\ncreep constantly to and fro, and so deposit the pol- \\nlen on the stigma. After this is done, the flower \\nsinks, the hair, which obstructed the passage, shrinks \\nand adheres closely to the sides of the flower ; by \\nwhich means the small confined gnats get free and \\nmay now accomplish their farther destination. Who \\nbut must admire the wise provision of nature in fe- \\ncundating this seemingly trifling flower ! Other in- \\nstances of this kind could be mentioned. The dich- \\nogamic plants can be in no other way fecundated \\nthan by insects. Many flowers blossom in succes- \\nsion on one plant, and the restless insect, which \\nflies from one flower to another, carries the pollen \\nto them all. Epilobium angmtifolium may serve as \\nan instance of male Dichogamy, and Euphorbia Cy- \\nparissias as an instance of female Dichogamy. \\nHomoo^amic flowers, that is, such flowers as liave \\n\\nS48 \\nPRINXIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\ntheir male and female organs of generation formed \\nat the same time, are mostly impregnated by them- \\nselves. Several, however, are visited by insects, \\nwhich complete what perhaps was not completed in \\nthe usual way, or what rain, wind, or unfavourable \\nweather interrupted at the proper period. \\nIn these flowers, the following arrangement is \\nmade : When the stamens are larger than the pistil, \\nthe tlower stands upright, and the stamens incline \\nthemselves over the pistil; or it lies horizontally, \\nand the stamens curve themselves archways toward \\nthe style, so as to become of the same length with \\nthe pistil. Of the first kind the Parnassia p^/z/.sYn> \\nis an instance. In it the stamens, five in number, \\nrecline all over the pistil in the following order: \\nFirst, one of the stamens places itself across the \\nsti,2;ma, lets its pollen go, then rises up and resumes \\nits former position. In the mean time the second is \\nalready following in the same manner, and as soon \\nas the first rises from the stia;ma, the other covers \\nit ; the third succeeds like the two first, but as soon \\nas it has risen, the two last come both at once. To \\nthe second kind belong the horse chesnut, (Aesculus \\nHippoahstanum), and others. \\nBut if in homogamic flowers the stamens arc short- \\ner than the pistil, the flower is pendulous, so that \\nthe pollen, when ialling ofl\" may be enabled to per- \\nform its functions. Rarely have such flowers an ob-. \\nlique or horizontal position, and in this case the \\nstyle turns backwards, to reach the stamens. Some \\npendulous flowers, however, can be fecundated only \\nt)y insects, as their stigma is so situated that the pol- \\n5 \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n249 \\nIcn does not directly fall upon it ; but then these \\nflowers have, as mentioned before, hair or other \\nprocesses, which oblige the insect to enter them \\nalong the stigma ; so that, when they return or visit \\nthe flower repeatedly, they must rub the pollen a- \\ngainst the stigma. \\nSuch plants as are of different sexes and on one \\nstem have both female and male flowers, are mostly \\nimpregnated by insects alone. Only thobc impregnate \\nthemselves, which have no nectaries, and where the \\nmale flowers stand close to the female flovv\\'crs, as in \\nsome species of »jramina ; Typha ; Coix ; Carcx, \\nand others. In that case such flowers have their \\nfemale flowers situated lower than tlic male flowers, \\nand their petals are very minutely or very deep- \\nly divided, so that the jwlien when failing, can \\nreach them. This is the case, for instance, with \\nthe different species of Pinus and similar trees. Here \\nprobably the wind too is of some service. It dis- \\nperses the pollen in the air, so as often to involve \\nthe tree in a kind of cloud. The sulphur rain, as \\nit has been called, which falls sometimes in spring, \\nafter thunder storms, [)roceeds from the pollen of \\n(he Pinus sylvestris. \\nSuch plants as have on one stem male flowers \\nonly, on another female flowers alone, are all pro- \\nvided with nectaries, and the male flowers are lar- \\nger and more obvious than the female, to allow \\nmore readily the insects to carry the pollen to the \\nfemale plant. \\nThe V^alisneria spiralis, a water-plant of Italy, is \\nof difl\\'erent sexes ; in this the male flower parts \\n\\nPRINCIPLES OP BOTANY, ETC. \\nwith the stem, and swims upon the water, that the \\naquatic animals may the sooner carry its pollen to \\nthe female plant. \\nMany foreign plants flower with us, having dis- \\ntinctly formed hermaphrodite flowers, but notwith- \\nstanding hear no seeds. The climate, however, is \\nnot always the cause of their barrenness, but the \\nwant of insects, which nature destined in their na- \\ntive countries to fecundate their seeds, and which \\nwe have not, along with the transplanted, received \\ninto our gardens. One experiment will confirm the \\ntruth of this observation : The Abroma augusta \\nflowered for many years here, in a hot-house, where \\nno insects had access, without ever bearing a single \\nfruit. The gardener tried the experiment to put the \\npollen, by means of a hair brush, upon the stigma \\nof several flowers, and he got perfectly formed \\nfruit, which again gave him new plants. In many \\nother cases this has been done, which the limits of \\nthis work will not permit us to mention. Might it \\nnot be adviseable for gardeners, who wish to make \\ncherry-trees or other fruit-trees bear very early in \\ntne season, when they often get little or no fruit at \\nall, to place a bee-hive with bees in the hot-house, \\nand at the same time, to take care to let these \\nbusy insects get as many flowers as possible? \\n{ 297. \\nNature seems to have given a high degree of \\nirritability to some plants, merely to promote \\ngeneration. Berberis mlgaris has very irritable \\nstamens, for if they are bent only a little, they \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n351 \\ninstantly rebound back to the pistil. Dr Smith \\nfound that a small part of them only is possessed of \\nthis irritability. Cactus tuna lias likewise a great \\ndeal of irritability in its stamens. If they are touch- \\ned with a quill, they all incline over the pistil. As \\nsoon, therefore, as insects touch these irritable spots \\nin those plants, the irritabihty exerts itself, and \\nstimulates the parts, and produces generation. Se- \\nveral plants have these kinds of stamens, for instance \\nthe whole family of Asclepias, &c. \\nThe elasticity of the stamens also must in some \\nplants produce generation, for instance, in Lopezia ; \\nUrtica ; Parietaria ; Medicago ; Kalmia ; and others. \\nThe style of some flowers seems to possess some \\ndegree of irritability, as it follows the stamens with \\nits stisjma. \\nThe shutting and opening of flowers caUcd their \\nVigiliae 7), do not belong to this subject, though \\nby the way they may contribute something to pro- \\nmote generation. It would appear that light sti- \\nmulates these parts, and produces an expansion* \\nFor this reason perhaps, most flowers open in sun- \\nshine. Portulaca oleracca^ and Drosera rotundijolia, \\nare very powerfully stimulated, and- therefore open \\nabout 1^ o\\'clock mid-day; but this violent stimulus \\nrelaxes their fibres so much earlier, and they shut \\nin an hour after. The stimulus of day light appears \\nto be too powerful for Oenothera biennis, and it \\ncannot open till free from the influence of strong \\nlight. It remains open during the night, from even- \\ning till morning, and if the succeeding day is cool \\nand cloudy, it will not close its flowers at all. \\n\\n352 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nThe fibre of some flowers, seems to act like a liy- \\ngrometer, in such a manner that the flower opens \\nby means of moisture, and shuts in a dry atmosphere. \\nThis is observed in all the species of Carlina. But \\nis it the too ])owciful stimulus of the light of the \\nsun, which occasions Nymphaea alhay to close in \\nthe evening, and during the night to continue im- \\nmersed in the Avater ? \\nLight appears also to operate on the separation of \\nthe fine fragrant matter of flowers, so that in some, \\nthis matter is separated merely by heat and liglit, \\nin others, by heat alone, and rendered perceptible \\nto our organs of smell. \\nIt is requisite for the performance of generation, \\nthat the stigma be moist, and the anthers covered \\n\"with pollen 296), if there is any medium which \\nprevents both, it cannot talce place. Water does not \\ncombine with the pollen, and therefore the rain \\nwashes it away ; most flowers have such a direction, \\nthat they cannot easily be affected by rain, but notwith- \\nstanding that we see that a long continuance of rainy \\nweather may frustrate the harvest of corn and fruit. \\nOn this account, almost all aquatic plants that \\nare provided with visible blossoms, raise their flowers \\nabove the surface of the water, and after the blos- \\nsoming, the unripe fruit sinks down. Only those \\nwater plants, which belong to the cryptogamous \\nclass, and some few, such as Najas, Caulinia, Cera- \\ntophyllum, which have mucilaginous pollen appa- \\nrently capable of combining with water, evolve their \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY \\n353 \\nflowers under its surface ; it even would seem that \\nthe macilaginous pollen of the Asclepiades, and Or- \\nchides, perhaps suffers from water. \\nKoelreuter examined, in a very laborious manner, \\nhow many grains of pollen might be required for a \\ncomplete impregnation. His chief discoveries on \\nthis point are as follow : \\nAll the anthers of Hibiscus syriacits contained \\n4863 grains of pollen, no more than 50 or 60 of \\nwhich were necessary to a complete impregnation^ \\nBut whenever he took less than 50 grains, the seeds \\ndid not ail ripen, but those which were formed, were \\nperfect. Ten granules were the least he could take \\nin this flower, as less would not suffice for it. The \\nMirabilis Jalapa had 293 globules of pollen in one \\nflower, Mirabilis longijlora 321. And in each of the \\ntwo plants, only 2 or 3 globules were sufficient for \\nimpregnation. The seed did not appear more per- \\nfect, though many more grains were put upon the \\nstigma. \\nTo ascertain whether, in flowers with several styles, \\neach must be impregnated separately, Kdelreuter in \\nseveral of them cut all ofl\\' but one, and the fecun- \\ndation was as perfect as could be expected with all \\nthe styles. Even in flowers, in which the style was \\nentirely separated, fecundation took place through \\none of them. This experiment shows, that the \\ntubes of one style communicate with all the rest, \\n{>nd that more styles and more pollen are formed, \\nmerely to ensure their determination. From this \\nz \\n\\n354 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC \\ncircumstance philosophers have concluded, that the \\ncellular texture of all germens fixed in the receptaclcy \\nmust have some general connection. \\n§ 300. \\nThe great and wonderful process of generation \\nhas led various philosophers to form very peculiar \\nhypotheses, which each has tried to establish by a \\nnumber of arguments. \\nTo give an accurate account of all of them, would \\nbe transgressing the bounds of our present re- \\nsearches ; it will suffice to mention only the most im- \\nportant. The first natural philosophers thought, \\nthat an accidental mixture of sohd and liquid \\nparts was sufficient to form, according to cir- \\ncumstances, animals or plants This was called \\nGeneratio aequivoca. Others imagined, that the \\nsmall animals which were observed {in the se- \\nmen, (animalcula spermatica)^ go into the ovaries \\nof the mother, and thus form the future being. \\nOthers again, l)elieved that in the mother a rudiment \\nof the future animal pre-existed, to which the semen \\nof the male imparted life. However, this theory was \\ncalled the system of pre-formation, or the Systema \\npraeformationis, praedd\\'meationis, or the theory of e- \\nvolution. Those three appellations properly denoted \\nthree different ideas ; but in reality they all concur \\nin this one point, that all three suppose a pre-exis- \\ntence of the future being in the mother. Lastly, \\nphilosophers alleged, that the fecundating fluids \\nboth of.female and male become mixed together, and \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n353 \\nthus give existence to the future animal. This theory \\nwas styled, Epigenesis. \\nThe generatio aequivoca, was supposed in former \\ntimes chiefly to take place in insects, worirs and \\nplants, but it is now entirely abandoned by all ra- \\ntional men. Harvey\\'s doctrine is now well known, \\nomne vivum ex ovo ; farther observations of philoso- \\nphers daily confirm this truth, by new important ob- \\nservations. I would indeed no longer notice this \\nold theory, did not some botanists explain the for- \\nmation of Fungi, merely by the fermentation of pu- \\ntrifying vegetable matter ; their sudden rise, and \\nthe places which some of them always occupy, led \\nthem to form this idea. \\nThough Patrin, and some later philosophers, \\nsuppose, that the last members of the organized \\nbody may, like the species of Boletus, and the in- \\ntestinal worms, have their origin from generatio \\naequivoca ; I must confess that their hypotliesis, \\nnotwithstanding its ingenuity, never appeared to me \\nsufficiently plain. \\nThe theory of animalcula in the semen of animals \\nbeing carried over to the ovarium of the mother, \\nwhere the new animal is formed, has Leuwenhoeck \\nfor its author. Some in the vegetable kingdom, as- \\nsumed pre-existing germs or corcles in the pollen, \\nwhich in the mother\\'s ovaries, formed the future plant. \\nThe most zealous supporter of this opinion was Mr \\nGleichen. Some even went so far as to see, under \\nthe microsccpe, small asses in the semen of an ass, \\nand small lime trees in the pollen of a lime. Strange \\nthings may be seen, if persons are disposed to see \\nz 2 \\n\\n$56 \\nPRINCIPLES or BOTANY, ETC. \\nthem. Koelreuter\\'s observations, which we shall \\nnotice in the sequel, at once overthrows this doc- \\ntrine. \\nThe system of prc-formation, which in former \\ntimes was generally admitted, is now even by its \\nmost zealous admirers, much doubted in the vege- \\ntable kingdom. Spallanzani, who in animals, by \\nmeans of tedious experiments, attempted to prove \\nthe pre-existence of the animal, before the impreg- \\nnation of the ovum in the ovaries, freely confesses, \\nthat there is no pre-existence of plants like that in \\nanimals. \\nThe Epigenesis, or generation by a commixture \\nof the fluids given out both by male and female, is \\nwhat most physiologists now assume as the only \\ntrue theory of generation both in the animal and \\nvegetable kingdoms. Koelreuter confirmed it by \\nnumerous experiments, of which we shall mention \\none only : He planted the Nicotiana rustica and \\npaniculata. The first he deprived of all its stamens, \\nand fecundated its pistil with pollen of the last spe- \\ncies. Necotiana rustica has egg-shaped leaves, and \\na short, greenish yellow corol. Nicotiana panicula- \\nta, a stem half as long again as the former, and \\nroundish, cordate leaves, and much longer, yellow- \\nish green corols. The bastard offspring of both, \\nkept in all its parts the middle betwixt the two spe- \\ncies. He tried the same with more plants, and the \\nresult accorded perfectly with the first. \\nWere we therefore to admit the animalcula semi- \\nTialia, the hybrids could necessarily not have differed \\nin their form from the male plant ; and; on the other \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n357 \\nhand, were the system of evolution founded in nature, \\nthey would have the same form as the female plant. \\nThe hybrid, however, was intermediate between \\nboth; it therefore certainly adopted some parts \\nboth from father and mother, and was formed by \\nEpigenesis. \\n§ 301. \\nKoelreuter, could anly obtain hybrids by inter-\\' \\nmixing similar plants. Dissimilar plants never pro- \\nduced them, even though, according to our system, \\nthey belonged to one genus. It appears by this, \\nthat nature seeks to avoid unnatural mixtures. \\nThe instance of mules not generating, as it was \\nonce believed at least, induced many philosophers \\nto make it an axiom, that hybrids are barren. But \\nwe now know a good many instances in Zoology of \\nhybrids being very productive, and even the in- \\nstance of mules does not prove any thing, as in \\nwarm climates they are sometimes prolific. \\nKoelreuter hkewise found hybrids of various spe- \\ncies of tobacco and some more plants to be sterile^ \\nthe pistil in them being perfect, but the stamens not \\ncompletely formed. But there are now several in- \\nstances of hybrid plants which retain their original \\nform, and propogate themselves. I shall mention a \\nfew with their parents : \\nSorbus hybrida. The mother was Sorbus aucujjaria; \\nthe father, Crataegus Aria. \\nKhamnus hybridus. The mother was Rhamnua al- \\npinus ; the father, Rhamnus Alatenm, \\nz 3 \\n\\n358 \\nPRINCIPLES Of BOTANY, ETC. \\nWhat mixtures do not the species of Pelargoniunm \\nproduce in our gardens? All plants of the 21st, \\n22d, and 2 3d classes of Linn6 mostly generate pro- \\nlific hybrids. Linn6 wrote a particular treatise on \\nhybrids, in which he attempted to explain the origin \\nof some particular plants ; but unfortunately he has \\ngiven nothing but conjectures, for none of his obser- \\nvations accord with experience. \\nShould it not, from the observations made with re- \\ngard to the hybrids of the animal and vegetable \\nworld, be laid down as a rule, with some ex- \\nceptions, that all hybrids are productive, but that \\nsome only want a warm climate, to unfold the male \\nsemen ? I do not attempt to establish this rule as a \\ncertain truth ; I rather wish, that philosophers would \\nconsider this subject more accurately, and attend \\nmore to the hybrids of different climates, in order \\nto discover the truth. \\nBut Koelreuter made some experiments, which \\nafford the clearest proof of the doctrine of Epigenesis \\nand the fructification of plants. I shall only men- \\ntion one of his observations as an instance. He ob^ \\ntained, a hybrid from Nicotiana rustica and pamcu^ \\nlata. Nicotiana rustica was the female plant, pa- \\nniculata the male. The hybrid, like ail the others \\nwhich he brought up, had imperfect stamens, and \\nkept the medium between the two species. He af- \\nterwards impregnated this hybrid with Nicotiana \\npaniculata, and got plants, which much more resem- \\nbled the last. This he continued through several ge- \\nnerations, till in this way, by due perseverance, he \\nactually changed the Nko^iana riifftka into tlie Ni-r \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGY. \\n369 \\ncotiana paniculata. By these and other experiments, \\noften repeated, and made in various M ays and upon \\nother plants, it is quite obvious, that there is no pre- \\nformation in plants. \\nAccording to the theory of Epigenesis then, the \\nj fluids of the male and female are mixed, and an ofF- \\n. spring is obtained from these two, which in form and \\nproperties resembles both father and mother. \\nIt were to be wished that all theories could be \\n. proved in as convincing a manner, as generation can \\nJbe demonstrated by the number of discoveries on \\nthis head, made in the animal and vegetable kingr \\ndom. \\nI 302. \\nBut there have been })hilosophers, both in former \\nand modern times, who in plants have altogether de- \\nnied the existence of sexes. Smellie seems to fa- \\nvour this opinion, as he repeated an experiment of \\nSpallanzani\\'s, with a female plant of hemp, which he \\nkept remote from all male plants, and notwithstand- \\ning obtained, though in a small quantity, perfect seeds, \\nand hence he deduces his argument. But such ex- \\nperiments are too difficult to be free from error, and \\nwho can positively assert, that he has not, even with \\nthe greatest attention, been deceived ? Spallanzani \\nplaced his female plant in a room, to which no in- \\nsects could get, and, for the greater security, likewise \\ncovered it. But could he, before the first flower ap- \\npeared, distinctly enough distinguish the female plant \\nof the hemp? And could not a very small, minute \\ninsect escape his eyes, and eflect a fecundation ? Be- \\nz 4 \\n\\n560 \\n^llINCirLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nsides, how often do we find on hermaphrodite plants \\na single stamen, which perhaps was here the case ? \\nThe few seeds which he got, prove, that a few single \\nparts were necessarily fecundated. But even suppo- \\nsing that in hemp, the female plant produces ripe seeds \\nwithout fecundation, can we apply any conclusion how- \\never just from this single plant, to every other vegetable. \\nWe have in the animal kingdom an instance in the \\nAphis, an insect which, without the aid of a male, \\npropagates itself till autumn. But who would, from \\nthis isolated observation, founded as it is in truth, \\nattempt to deny in all animals the existence of a dif- \\nference of sex ? Since GleditscH first, in a botanic \\ngarden, impregnated the Chamaerops humilis, which \\nis a female plant, with pollen of the male plant, which \\nKoelruter sent to him from Karlsruhe, and obtained \\nripe seeds and young plants, which before never had \\nbeen possible, thousands of sunilar experiments have \\nbeen made, which put it beyond doubt that two sex- \\nes exist in plants. Every person may, indeed, easily \\nconvince himself of the fact, by repeating such ex- \\nperiments on the species of melon and gourd, and \\neverywhere in the vegetable kingdom, he will find \\ntwo distinct sexes. \\nJ 303. \\nThe seed, (f 29^), already exists in the germen \\nduring the time of blooming, before fecundation takes \\nplace, and contains a very clear liquor, called by \\n!Malpighi the Chorion. With this, most likely, the \\nfecundating particle of the male semen is mixed, and \\nthus produces the embryo of the future plant. Koel- \\n\\nPHYSIOLOGT* \\n361 \\nreuter, however, thinks that the moisture of the stig- \\nma, which he, according to his favourite idea of an \\noily, impregnating fluid in vegetables, supposes like- \\nwise to be oily, is mixed with the fluid of the male, \\nand that these two combined, are conveyed into the \\nseed. However, be this as it will, a great alteration \\nis observed to take place in the seed sooner or later \\nafter fecundation, according to the variety of plants. \\nFor in the neighbourhood of the navel a small ve- \\nsicle appears, filled with some liquid. The vesicle \\nis called the saccuhui colliquamentiy and the liquor in \\nit, the amnios. This vesicle grows larger, absorbs \\nthe chorion, w hich at last entirely disappears, so that \\nthe cuticle finally becomes the mcmbrana interna of \\nthe seed, 1 16). The ^777?/^/o5 grows hard, and forms \\nthe cotyledons, 1 16). As soon as the vesicle shews \\nitself, the embryo of the future plant likewise appears \\ngradually, which consists in the corcle, ( 1 c.) It is \\nformed gradually, and becomes visible in the sun- \\nflower, (lielianthus anmius ), three days after impreg- \\nnation ; in the cucumber, (Cucumis sativus)^ a week \\nafter; and in meadow saffron, (Colchicum autum- \\nnciiej some months after. It is flaky in the begin- \\nning, but in time becomes, like the vesicle which \\n/contains it, larger and firmer. The vesicle does \\nnot in all seeds increase in the same form, in some \\nit grows larger in its whole circumferenco, in others \\nit crows lonrjer towards one extremitv, which runs \\nstraight out to the opposite wall, and the sides arc \\njextcnded. \\n\\n362 \\nriilNCirjLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nThus tJie seed comes to maturity and when per- \\nfectly ripe, separates m different ways from its mo- \\nther plant, and begins a new life itself, passing \\nthrough all the scenes again, just now explained. \\nThis is the common way in which plants are propa- \\ngated. But we have plants, which do it in another \\nway besides evolving their seeds. At the stem, or \\nnear the angles of the leaves, by nature or even through \\naccident the spiral vessels of plants form sometimes \\nknots, which become buds, and separating sponta- \\nneously from the plant itself, send out roots and \\nleaves, thus forming an entirely new plant of the \\nsame species. Such plants are called viviparous \\nplants, (vegetabi/ia viviparaj. Several species of \\ngarlic, ( Allium ) ; the Lilium bulbiferum ; Poa bul- \\nhosa and other plants, do this spontaneously. The \\ngarden tulip, (J^uW\\\\)\\'3i gesneriana ), exhibits this cu- \\nrious phenomenon by means of a simple manoeuvre \\nof art, if the flower is cut off, before impregnation \\nhas taken place, and the stem with the leaves be al- \\nlowed to remain, provided it be in a shaded spot. \\nSeveral succulent plants, for instance, Eucomis \\'punc- \\ntata, do it when treated in the above manner. Gar- \\ndeners increase plants by layers, suckers, grafts and \\ninoculation, in a similar manner. \\nThe bud of a tree or shrub, when grafted into a- \\nnother stock, will there be unfolded, and must in- \\ndeed be regarded as a different plant altogether. It \\nis not changed in its nature, but grows as if placed \\nin the earth ; the stem only serves to convey the im- \\nbibed sap to it, which it must itself digest according \\nto its nature. \\n\\n^ PHYSIOLOCr. \\nS63 \\nAgricola and Barnes, it appears, were more suc- \\ncessful in these operations, for they placed buds di- \\nrectly in earth, and produced perfect plants. \\n\\\\ 304. \\nIt is remarkable in this kind of artificial increase, \\nthat M\\'here branches or buds are in any way formed \\ninto new plants, by layers, grafts, or inoculation, the \\nplant from m hich they were taken, does not propa- \\ngate as species, but only as variety. If we take the \\npart of an individual^ and convert it into a particular \\nplant, in this way all the varieties may be multiplied. \\nThe seed therefore propagates only the species which \\nmay grow from it under many different appearances \\nas varieties, but in the branch as in the bud the germ \\nis already formed, and it is totally impossible that the \\nshoot issuing from them can alter in the least. Thus \\nis the apple of Borstdorf propagated by grafts ; in- \\noculation will always remain the same, but from the \\nseed will be obtained many varieties entirely diflbr- \\nent. \\n^ 305. \\nThe stem of ligneous plants, 264), annually \\nadds a new ring of vessels. The first circles begin \\nto become ligneous on their sides. The wood has, \\nin general, when young, a yellowish white colour, \\nwhich, according to the species of the plants, as- \\nsumes a darker hue every year. The quick circula- \\ntion of the sap takes place only in the young vascu- \\nlar circles ; in the older ones the sap is carried along \\nmuch slower, and they have their irritability greatly \\n1 \\n\\n664; PRINCIPLES OF BOTANf, ETC \\ndiminished. The life of every shrub or tree consists \\nOnly in the young rings of these vessels, which is \\ncalled inner bark, 280), and the plant must die \\nwhen this is wounded. Thus, if a ligneous plant has \\nperformed its offices for a number of years, then \\nthe innermost ring begins to be obstructed, and to \\nbecome more and more dense ; this occasions that \\nthose lying next them no longer obtain their moisture \\nfrom them. They therefore begin to move their sap \\nslower, and the youngest vascular circle becomes \\ngradually thinner and thinner. At last the sap stops \\nlikewise in the following ligneous ring ; the young \\nvascular circle cannot form itself completely; few \\nbuds are now unfolded ; the small number of leaves \\ncannot prepare sufficient sap for the whole, and the \\ncommon certain lot of organized bodies, death sets \\nthe final insurmountable bound to vegetations, \\n§ 306, \\nIn herbaceous plants all the vessels of the stem \\nbecome dry and hard in one year, and. as they can \\nno longer convey the sap, consequently the stem de- \\ncays at the end of the year. Their root forms, as \\nthe stem of ligneous plants does, annually a new vas- \\ncular circle, and it dies in the same manner, when \\nall those circles have become too ligneous. But such \\nherbs, the roots of which are annually renewed, are \\nof constant duration. The old root dies, its fibres \\nbeing entirely ligneous, but a new one appears, and \\nis to be considered as a young plant. \\n\\nPHYsroLOGt. 365 \\n§ 307. \\nHerbs, whether they live one year only, as the an- \\nnual plants, or two years, as biennial plants, become \\nso exhausted by the formation of the flower and \\nfruit, that the irritability of their vessels becomes \\nmuch impaired; they therefore become quite ligneous, \\nand the root and stem must decay after their fruits \\nare ripened. They may, however, be preserved for \\nseveral years, if their flowers, when in the bud, be \\ntaken off. The same happens when their flowers \\nare filled, in which case fecundation does not take \\nplace and, consequently, no fruit is formed. These \\nvessels retain that irritability which is necessary for \\ntheir duration, and which would have been lost by \\nthe wasting of their strength, and their fibres become \\nligneous more slowly. \\n§ SOS. \\nNatural death, is not the same in all vegetables- \\nAs in all organized bodies it ensues in three ways. \\nFirst, by the induration of the fibre, as in trees, \\nshrubs and under shrubs. Secondly, by the powers \\nbeing exhausted, {§ 307), as in aiinual and biennial \\nplants. Lastly, by dissolution, as in soft Fungi and \\nthe species of Boletus. These plants imbibe a great \\nquantity of moisture, which increases with their age. \\nIn them no part becomes ligneous, but they die in \\ntoo softened a state, and putrify from a superfluity of \\nmoisture. \\n\\n366 \\nPllINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\n§ 509. \\nThe duration of life differs greatly in different \\nplants. Some species of Boletus require only a few \\nhours for their evolution, and as soon again decay. \\nSeveral fungi live only a few days, others weeks \\nand months. Annual plants live three, four, or at \\nthe utmost eight months. Biennial plants continue \\nsixteen, eighteen, and even twenty four months. \\nMany herbaceous plants grow a few years, but se- \\nveral a long series of years. There are some shrubs \\nand trees which can live eight, ten, a hundred, even \\na thousand years. With us the oak and lime-tree \\nattain to the greatest age. The former may live \\nsix or eight centuries and above, and stems, almost \\nas old, have been seen of the latter. But the trees, \\nwhich in our globe arrive at the greatest age, are \\nbeyond doubt the Adansonia digitata, (J 267); the \\nPinus Cedrus, and the different species of palm. The \\nAdansonia probably lives longest of all, as its \\nage is computed to be one, if not many, thousand \\nyears. \\n\\nVI. DISEASES OF PLANTS. \\n§ 310. \\nPlants are, like all other organized bodies, sub- \\nject to a great many diseases. The most com- \\nmon causes are, improper soils, preternatural habi- \\ntations, late frosts at night time, long continued \\nrain, great drought, violent storms, parasitic plants, \\ninsects and wounds of various kinds. \\nDisease we call in plants that preternatural state \\nby which their functions, or at least some of them, \\nsuffer, and the purpose for which they are destined \\nprevented. \\nJ311. \\nThe diseases of plants are of different kinds ; they \\nattack either the whole plant, and are then called \\ngeneral diseases; or they only affect single parts, \\nwhen they get the name of local diseases. We style \\nthose diseases Sporadic, which out of a great number \\nof the same species of plants, only attack one or \\ntwo, as consumption. Epidemic, on the contrary, \\n\\n368 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANr, JETC. \\nwhen they attack a great number of plants, such as \\ngangrene, necrosis, rubigo, and others. \\n§ S12. \\nThe diseases of plants are either such as attack \\nthem externally, and are occasioned by various \\ncauses, or they proceed from internal sources. The \\nformer are, upon the whole, much more easily heal- \\ned than the latter. The diseases, which proceed \\nfrom internal causes, originate in the increased or \\ndiminished irritability of the fibre, and this may be \\nalso produced by a variety of causes. \\nThe cure of plants is very simple : either the in- \\njured part is cut off, or the soil, the situation, and \\ntile degree of temperature, altered. To these ex- \\npedients only, the healing of all plants is restricted. \\nIn vegetables, as well as in animals, diseases occur \\nwhich are incurable, as consumption, canker when \\nit is concealed, mutilation, deformity, &c. Most of \\nthem, however, may be remedied. \\nJ 313. \\nViilmcSf or a wound, is the separation of the solid \\nparts by external violence- It may be occasioned \\npurposely by cutting olf branches, or accidental \\nrubbing off; by friction of cattle; or by friction \\nagainst another object, when the wind agitates the \\nstem ; by the bite of animals ; by the falling off of \\nthe parasitic plants ; or even by very large hail- \\nstones. In all these cases, it is necessary to prevent \\nthe access of air to it, by some gcod firm cement, \\nor grafting wax. But if the wound has remained \\n4 \\n\\nDISEASES OF PLANTS. \\n369 \\nlong uncovered, and exposed both to wind and rain, \\nand is of a great size, then the affected part must \\nbe cut off down to the sound wood, to prevent \\ngreater mischief, and the whole afterwards be cover- \\ned with wax. \\nThe means of preventing wounds are obvious. — \\nBranches must be cut off cautiously ; the access of \\ncattle must be obstructed ; trees brought up, so as \\nnot to be fastened to stakes; or, if it cannot be \\navoided, to place three or four posts or stakes round \\neach, and tie them up very gently. In violent \\nstorms, it is indeed better to let them loose, and \\nleave them to themselves. Parasitic plants must be \\neradicated. Against the bite of smaller animals, \\nand hail, precautions cannot always be taken. \\nFractura. Fracture is the separation of the stem \\nand branches into many pieces. This may arise \\nfrom the violence of the wind, from too great an \\nabundance of fruit, much snow, or even from light- \\nening. It is remarkable, that lightening runs along \\nevery species of trees, almost always in a different \\nmanner. The birch (Betula alha,) is, in this re- \\nspect, different from all other trees, that the lighten- \\ning never runs along its stem, but only at the top \\nbeats off the boughs almost in a circular direction. \\nA fracture, if not complicated, and on branches \\nor young stems only, may be healed without difficul- \\n.ty. But when accompanied with contusion, or hap- \\npening in trunks of old or gummy trees, no way of \\nrecovery is known. \\nA a \\n\\n870 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nIn young trees and branches, even sometimes in \\nold ones, when instantly discovered, fractures heal \\neasily, especially in spring till the end of June, pro- \\nvided every part be brought into its natural position, \\nfirmly tied up, and properly supported. But if \\nthere is contusion, or if a thick stem or bough is \\naffected, the bough must be cut off, or the stem \\ncut down, to get new^ shoots from the stock or \\nfrom the root. \\nTo prevent such an accident, trees with fragile \\nboughs must be, as much as possible, sheltered from \\nthe wind. Fruit-trees should not, when pruned, \\nhave all their gems left ; and care should be taken \\nin gardens, that the snow do not overload the \\nboughs. Against the flash of lightening, no means \\nare of any service, except bringing conductors — a \\nplan which would be too expensive, and even im- \\npracticable. \\n§ 315. \\nFissura. Fissure is the separation of the solid \\nparts into an oblong cleft, which ensues spontane- \\nously. It proceeds from two causes ; fulness of \\njuice, ( polysarca,) or from frost. \\nTo heal a split, nothing else is required than to \\nput good grafting wax on the wound, that the rain \\nor other contents of the atmosphere may not destroy \\nthe stem. \\nTo prevent clefts, the bleeding or scarifying, as \\nit is called, of such trees, the bark of which is very \\nhard, may be of service. A moderate incision is \\nmade through the bark longitudinally ; and a plant \\n\\nDISEASES OF PLANTS. \\n371 \\nthat has too rich a soil, by which it becomes too \\nsucculent, should be transplanted into a poorer soil- \\nTo defend them against frost, plants should be co- \\nvered with straw. \\nA cleft occasioned by frost, sometimes degene- \\nrates into a chilblain, (per7iio,J from which after- \\nwards, especially in oaks, a blackish sharp liquor \\nexudes, which at last produces exulceration, {§ 327.) \\n^316. \\nDefoUatio notha is when the leaves fall not at \\nthe proper period, but much earlier. It is occasion- \\ned by men, insects, acrid fumes, dust, and constant \\ndry weather. \\nIn whatever way it may happen, all depends on \\nthe nature of the plant affected with it, and on the \\nseason of the year in which it happens. If it be a \\nfast growing tree, and the injury happens before \\nAugust, the tree may, if taken good care of, easily \\nget leaves again, only it will have smaller foliage for \\nthe present season. But if the leaves fall after that \\nperiod, and cool weather comes on earlier than \\nusual, or if it happens at a much later season, the \\nplant may be unwell for several years before a com- \\nplete recovery takes place. If, on the contrary, it \\nhappens late in autumn, just before the natural fall \\nof the leaves, then it has no bad consequences ; ex- \\ncept the plants be natives of a warmer climate, and \\nthe branches, which have appeared already, be not \\nvet hard enough, in which case they will lose those \\nbranches, and perhaps some of the older ones, by \\nthe invasion of cold. The defoliation by men, which \\nA a 2 \\n\\nS72 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nis performed sometimes in spring, particularly with the \\nmulberry-tree for bringing up the silk-worm, should \\nbe avoided, or at least done with moderation. \\nInsects which are noxious to plants, should be ac- \\ncurately known, and their way of propagation under- \\nstood, in order to obviate the bad effects which they \\nproduce, and to check their too great increase. \\nChange of place is the only means of preventing \\nthe noxious influence of acrid fumes, of great ma- \\nnufactures and iron-works and the like, as well as of \\ndust. \\nIn long continued drought, careful watering is ad- \\nviseable. \\nThe falling off of the leaves in autumn is quite \\nconsistent with nature, and of no bad consequence \\nwhatever ; except, perha{>s, when the leaves are \\ndropping off too soon, on account of early night \\nfrosts, and these can affect only delicate foreign \\nplants, of which care should be taken. \\n§ 317. \\nHaeniorrhag\\'ia is of two kinds^ spontaneous or \\noccasioned by wounds. \\nThe birch and mapple, when wounded, emit a \\ngreat quantity of juice, which, when allowed to \\nflow too copiously, may end in the death of the \\nplant. \\nSpontaneous haemorrhagy arises from the great ir- \\nritability of tlie plant, and the soil is generally the \\naccidental cause. The soil is either what, in com- \\nmon language, is called too rough ; that is, it pro- \\nmotes too rapid a separation of the juices, which, \\n\\nDISEASES OP PLANTS. \\n373 \\non account of their large quantity, cannot be received \\ninto the vessels, and therefore must be discharg- \\ned, and then they acquire in the air a corrosive pro- \\nperty, by wiiich the parts are destroyed ; or the soil \\nis too rich in general, rendering the plant full of \\njuices, but unable to retain the moisture, which, \\ntherefore, without corroding the posterior parts, they \\ndischarge, or deposit only externally their gummy \\nconstituents. In most cases, spontaneous haemorr- \\ntiagy is incurable. \\nSpontaneous haemorrhagy, from superabundance \\nof sap, is either gumnious, as in fruit-trees, or of a \\nwatery nature, as in the vine. This last species has \\nI been styled lacrymatio. The gummous haemorrhagy \\nproves rarely fatal, but should not be allowed to \\nmake too much progress, and the wound should be \\nhealed up by wax. The watery haemorrhagy in the \\nvine, has no bad consequences whatever; for this \\nplant is the same in winter as all ligneous plants, \\n281). The radicles of it, which have been form- \\ned during the cold season, imbibe a great deal of \\nmoisture from the ground, which they convey to the \\nstem. But as the weather is not soon enough fa- \\nvourable for the shooting of it, and as the radicles \\nimbibe more sap than the tender stalks can contain, \\nthe superfluous sap exudes from the gems or buds. \\nIn warm chmates, the vine does not lacrymate ; for \\nthere the leaves can unfold themselves instantly, and \\nthe sap of course is properly digested. This wa- \\ntery discharge of the vine is not, therefore, to be \\nconsidered as a natural secretion, peculiar to the \\nA a 3 \\n\\n374 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANV, ETC. \\nplant, but as the effect of cold climates. It, how- \\never, does not hurt the plant. \\n{318. \\nAlbigo, or mildew, is a ^yhitish mucilaginous coat- \\ning of the leaves of plants, which often causes \\ntheir decay. It is produced by small plants, or by \\ninsects. The first kind appears on the leaves of \\nTussilago Farfara, Humulus Lupulus, Corylus Avel- \\nlana, Lamium album, purpureum, and others. It \\nis a small species of fungus, of great minuteness, \\nwhich covers the leaves : Linn6 calls it Mucor Eryz \\nsiphe. \\nThe second kind is a whitish slime, which some \\nspecies of Aphis deposit on the leaves. \\nAs soon as there is the least appearance of mil- \\ndew, all the leaves stained with it should be plucked \\noff and burned. In scarce and delicate i)lants, the \\nleaves ought to be washed. But where it is pro- \\nduced by aphides, a weak decoction of the dry leaves \\nof tobacco will be found most serviceable. \\nBut if all parts of a plant are attacked, and the \\nplant is hard and of long duration, then the parts \\nmust, according to the nature of the plant, be taken \\noff. If it is an annual plant, and of great delicacy, \\nit will be best to wash it, with a brush dipped in the \\ndecoction of tobacco, and afterwards to expose it to \\n^he open air. \\nI S19. \\nMelligOy or honey-dew, is a sweet and clear juice \\nwhich, during hot weather, is frequently found upon \\n\\nDISEASES OF PLANTS. \\n575 \\nthe leaves, rendering them sticky, and, especially \\nwhen there is a want of rain, causing them to fall \\noff. This sweet matter is likewise secreted by aphi- \\ndes, from peculiar glands at the anus. \\nIn tender plants, washing with water, or vvith the \\nabove decoction, is of great benefit ; the fumes of \\ntobacco, likewise, kill the insects. \\n§ 320. \\nRubigo, or rust, appears on the leaves and stems \\nof many plants. It consists of yellow or brown \\nstains, which, when touched, give out a powder of \\nthe same colour which soils. Microscopical examina- \\ntion has shewn, that the rust-like matter is a small \\nfungus, which is called Aecidium, and the seed of \\nwhich form this brownish soiling powder. We find \\nthem frequently in the leaves and stems of Euphor- \\nbia CyparissiaSj Berberis vulgaris, Rhamnus cathar- \\nticuSy of some gramina, of wheat, oats, &c. If \\nthey are very numerous, especially in the different \\nspecies of gramina and corn, consumption of the \\nwhole plant is the consequence. \\nLittle can be done against this affection. In grain, \\nsome have recommended to moisten the seed, before \\nsown, in salt or lime water, or to spw grain from \\ncountries where this disease does not prevail, Pre- \\ncautions are of no use. \\nJ 321. \\nLepra is frequently met with on the trunks, espe- \\ncially of young trees. If trunks are so entirely co- \\nvered with algae, that the pores of the cutis are ot* \\nA a 4 \\n\\nPKINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nstructed, we call the distemper lepra. Old trees \\nhave their trunks full of algae, without suffering any \\ninjury, provided the smaller branches be free of \\nthem. But if young trees or shrubs grow in too \\nsterile a soil, in too thin a stratum of fertile soil, in \\ngravely soil, in improper situations, too moist or too \\ndry, if they are, against their nature, too much ex- \\nposed to wind, then they sicken, their bark cannot \\nperform, with proper vigour, the functions peculiar \\nto it as the skin of the tree, and they grow at last, \\neven at their young boughs, all over with fungi of all \\nkinds. Vigorous adjacent plants, which are perfect- \\nly sound, will have few or no fungi on their stems. \\nThe lepra increases sickness in plants, and they \\ndie at last of a consumption, if not cleared of the \\nfungi, if their cutis is not washed, and they are not \\ntransplanted to better situations and morc[})roper soils. \\n} 322. \\nGallae, or galls, are produced by small flying in- \\nsects, the Cynips of Linn6. Galls are round, fleshy, \\nvariously shaped bodies, y.hich appear on the stem, \\npetioles, peduncles, and the leaves. They are \\nformed in the following manner : The little insect \\npierces with its sting the substance of the plant, and \\ndeposits its eggs in this small aperture. The few air \\nvessels thus injured get a different direction, and \\ntwist round the egg. The irritation which the sting \\nproduces, occasions, as always in organized bo- \\ndies, a greater flow of the sap, towards the wound- \\ned place ; the sap is deposited in greater quan- \\ntity than it ought to be, and a flesbv excrescence \\n\\nDISEASES OF PLANTS. \\n377 \\narises. The little larva which leaves the egg is nou- \\nrished by the sap, grows \\' up, changes into a pupa, \\nand escapes at last as a perfect insect, which propa- \\ngates itself again in the same way. \\nIt is singular, that each particular fly produces a \\ngall of a peculiar form. This, perhaps, may depend \\non the peculiar structure of the eggs of each species ; \\nfor we find, that the eggs of different insects, when \\nviewed with the microscope, assume peculiar shapes. \\nOn tlie oak-tree, we find a variety of galls, likewise \\non the Salix, Cistus, Glechoma, Veronica, lliera- \\ndum, Salvia, and other plants. \\nThe galls of Salvia j&owi/\\'c\\'r^z, which got its name \\nfrom that circumstance, are said to be of a pleasant \\ntaste, and are considered as an exc^\\'Jent dish in the \\noriental countries. \\nTo remedy this aftection, we can do nothing, but \\ncut off the galls as soon as they appear ; yet this \\ncan be done only in very delicate plants, which we \\nwish to preserve. -The disease, however, rarely pro- \\nceeds such a length as to hurt the plant materially. \\n§ 323. \\nThe FoUiculiis cai^nosus folioruin, is a gall of a \\nparticular kind, which is subulate and acute. It is \\nfound in Populus fiigi^a and Tilia cvropaca, and co- \\nvers the whole surface of the leaf. It arises in the \\nsame way as the former, and by its great number, \\nsometimes sickens the plant. \\nContorsions, (contorsiones) owe their origin like- \\nwise to insects, which produce a swelling and con- \\ntortion of tb^ leaves ; hcnrq t^ -\\'^y become contorted, \\n\\n378 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC \\n■which is the characteristic feature of the disease. \\nIt occurs ill Cerastium, Veronica, Lotus, Vacci^ \\nniuni, \\n§ 329. \\nf^erruca, or wart, is a small protuberance, which \\noccurs chiefly in fruits, for instance in apples. Here \\ninsects are not the cause, but accidental occurrences. \\nOf the same kind are the ( naevi s. maculae J, moles. \\nThey arise from wounds of the cutis. Both diseases \\nare not hurtful, and, as yet, we know no means to \\nprevent them. \\nTuber Ugnosum is met with on trunks of trees. It \\nseems to be produced partly by insects, partly by \\nchanges of weather. It arises from a disturbance in \\nthe active vessels of the inner bark, which by the \\napplication of stimuli, several times convolve, with- \\nout forming buds or boughs. They form instead of \\nthis, great knobs, which often, in a bad situation, \\nespecially through moisture, exulcerate. It not un- \\nfrequently grows very large, without the least injui^ \\nto the tree. \\n§ S25. \\nSquamat\\'wnes, or spongy swellings, are produced \\nhke galls 322). A small insect lays its eggs in \\nthe apex of a bud. Thus injured, the branch, which \\nwas to be formed from the bud, cannot be properly \\nunfolded, it remains quite short ; all its leaves, there- \\nfore, expand themselves from one point, but they \\nare of small size. The whole has somewhat the \\n3 \\n\\nDISEASES OF PLANTS. \\n379 \\nappearance of a rose. This may be often seen in \\nwillows. \\nSuch spongy swellings are of bad consequence \\nwhen in great numbers. The only way to extirpate \\nthem, is, to cut iheni otf, before they are properly \\nformed. \\nThe Bedcguar occurs in roses only, and has the \\nsame origin as the former, with this difference, that \\nthe insect which gives rise to the Bedeguar, deposits \\na number of e^s in one heap, in the middle of the \\nbud. From this a fleshy mass of the size of a fist \\narises, which is covered all over with hair-like colour- \\ned elongations; but never has leaves. \\n{ 327. \\nChlorosis, is that affection of plants, when their \\ngreen colour entirely disappears, and all their parts \\ngrow whitish. It arises from diminished stimulus, \\nthe plants cannot excrete their oxygen, which there- \\nfore is accumulated. There arc three causes of \\ntlie disease, want of light ; insects ; and bad soil. \\nFrom what has been said before, 285), we know \\nthat a healthy plant emits oxygen gas in sun light, \\nand that the accumulation of this gas, when not e- \\nmitted, makes the green colour disappear, (§ 279). \\nAs soon as a plant is deprived of light, it cannot \\ndisengage the oxygen, hence it assumes a white co- \\nlour, which however instantly goes off, when the \\nrays of the sun are again admitted. This is the rea- \\nson why plants, in dark rooms, between great masses \\n\\n380 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANr, ETC. \\nof stone, in deep clefts of rocks, beneath the dark \\nshade of sbrubs and trees, &c. grow pale, and of a \\nwhitish colour. \\nInsects which bite off the radicles of plants, or \\neven nestle in them, and consume their food, debi- \\nlitate their vessels, render them insensible of the \\nstimulus of light, and at last chlorotic. This occurs \\nvery frequently in Secale cercale. Here no remedies \\nare of any use. \\nImproper soil, from which plants do not get a suf- \\nficient quantity of proper food, sometimes renders \\nthem chlorotic. In such cases plants may recover \\nby change of soil. \\nJ 328, \\nIcterus differs from chlorosis, only in its colour, \\nand by its cause, which is cold coming on early in \\nautumn. It is indeed the natural death of the \\nleaves, and can only hurt the plant itself, when the \\ncold begins in autumn before the due time. \\n§ 329. \\nAnasarca, or dropsy, arises in plants from long \\ncontinued rain, or too piofuse watering. Single \\nparts in this case, are pre ternatu rally swelled, and \\ncommonly putrify. Some of the bulbous and tube- \\nrous roots, for instance, are often greatly swelled \\nafter rain. Fruit becomes watery, and tasteless. \\nSeeds do not get ripe, or the plant pushes out young \\nshoots unseasonably from the stem. Most of the \\nsucculent plants suffer from too copious a supply of \\nwater. \\n\\nDISEASES OF PLANTS.- \\n381 \\nAnasarca in plants is generally incurable. \\n§ 330. \\nPhtfiirlasis is that disease of plants, where the \\nwhole of it is covered with small insects, which suck \\nout all its sap, suppress the function of transpiration, \\nand of course hinder the farther evolution of its \\nparts. This disease is produced by three different \\nspecies of insects. By the Aphis, of which each \\nplant has almost a peculiar species. By the Coc- \\ncus, of which there are various species. That which \\nin our hot-houses is mostly met with, the Coccus \\nHesperidumy is the most dangerous ; those which \\nare commonly found on the roots of Sceleranthus, \\nPolygonum and others, are loss noxious. The disease \\nis lastly produced by the Acarus tellarius, a small \\nmite, which in hot-houses likewise spins a very delicate \\nweb over the leaves of the plants, and thus destroys \\nthem. Against the Aphis, careful cleaning, or even \\nbrusliing with suds, or a decoction of tobacco ; or \\nstrong fumigation with tobacco ; or sulphur in close \\nrooms, may be of service. The same means may \\nalso be employed against the second species, where \\nit may be likewise very beneficial to place the plant \\nas soon as the temperature is mild in the open air, \\nin a shady but airy place. This last destroys the \\ncanker, which in hot-houses chiefly attacks the gene- \\nra Sida, Hibiscus, Dolichos and Phaseolus. \\nJ 331. \\nVmninatto, or worms, is not as in the animal \\nkingdom, produced by wm-ms, but by the larva of \\n\\n382 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\ninsects. The stem, leaves and fruits are attacked \\nby it. The stem of some trees is very often eaten \\nthrough, and must sometimes entirely decay on this \\naccount. The willow, (Salix alba) ; horse chesnut, \\n(Aesculus Hippocastanum) ; the Typha latifolia, may \\nin regard to the stem, serve as very common in- \\nstances. \\nThe leaves are often inhabited by the well known \\nmining-worm, especially the leaves of cherry-trees. \\nFruits, as plumbs, apples, pears, hazel-nuts, and \\nthe grain of corn, and the like, are inhabited by \\nthe larvae of insects, which sometimes destroy them. \\nExcept^the destruction of the larva, no remedies \\nwill resist these ravaging enemies. \\n§ 332. \\nTabes, or the consumption of a plant, is frequent- \\nly a consequence of the already mentioned diseases, \\nor those which we have still to explain. It may \\nhowever also originate from sterile, or improper soil, \\nunfavourable climate, aukward transplanting, exhaus- \\ntion of strength from too frequent flowering, insects, \\nulceration, &c. The whole plant gradually begins \\nto decline, and dries up. As soon as this disease \\nreally appears, help is rarely possible. \\nTeredo pinorvm, is a kind of tabes, which attacks \\nprincipally the alburnum and inner bark of pines. \\nThe disease arises from long continued dry weather, \\nor violent frost of long duration, especially after pre- \\nceding mild or warm w^eather, and violent gales of \\nwind.

Plants which suffer from \\ndebility have all their parts, stem, leaves, flowers, \\n&c. hanging down quite relaxed.

It is different from \\nconsumption in this, that the causes of it are only \\naccidental and may be removed, so that the plants may \\nstill recover. Bad growth is occasioned by parasitic \\nplants, twining plants, and too glutinous a soil. \\nWhen those impediments to growth are removed \\nthe plants will soon recover. \\n\\n384 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\n§ 335. \\nExutccratio is a corroded part of a plant, from \\nwhich proceeds an icliorous filthy water.

An ulcer often corrodes \\nwood, pith, or other parts of trees, from neglect of \\nthe gardener ; in this case, all that is affected, must, \\nwithout loss of time, be cut away, and as just now \\nmentioned, the access of moisture must be prevented \\nby the application of some grafting wax or cement. \\nFrom unknown causes, the bulbs of hyacinths and \\nother fleshy roots exulcerate.

It arises from late night frosts, severe cold in \\nwinter, burning heat, suppuration of tlie sap in single \\nbranches, and by smaller plants. \\nLate night frosts, very frequently kill young shoots \\nof plants, which therefore grow black, and shrink. \\nNo other preservative can be used against this than \\ncovering young plants as soon as cold nights may \\nbe dreaded. Some assert, that they have derived \\ngreat advantage from conductors of frost, which con- \\nsist of a compactly twisted cord of straw, directed \\ninto a vessel with water. From severe winter cold, \\nforeign trees suffer chiefly, and such of our native \\nplants as are very delicate. Their inner bark freezes, \\nbecomes black, and it is impossible to save them. \\nAll the wounded part must be clipped, and the main \\ntrunk with the roots only be allowed to remain, to \\npi oduce new shouts. Intense heat will produce tlie \\nsame bad effects in gardens, or even in forests, where \\nf<;i esters are permitted to remove the mosses and \\ndry leaves from the roots. Single branches some- \\ntimes, by the too rapid growth of others, are depriv- \\ned of their necessary food, and wither away. This \\nmay happen without any injury to the plant.

Plants affected with gangrene be- \\ncdtfie soft and moist in some single parts, which at \\nlast dissolve in a foul ichor. It chiefly attacks fruits, \\nflowers, leaves and roots, rarely the stem. Gan- \\ngrene arises either from too moist or too fat and lux- \\nurious ground, from infection and contusion. It \\nscarcely admits of a cure, as it infests only single \\nparts, but if the causes which give rise to it are re- \\nmoved it may be prevented. \\nUstilago, appears especially in the species of gra- \\nmina and grain ; rarely in other plants ; sometimes \\nin Scorzonera, Tra<2;opogon, &c. It arises from a \\nsmall fungus, which occupies the whole ear, which \\ntherefore cannot evolve. Every part of it, on the \\ncontrary, becomes a black, soiling mass. Moist sea- \\nsons are most favourable for its evolution, and its for- \\nmation is, under .such circumstances, very rapid. \\nThat corn may not be at}ected with it, such grain \\nonly should be sown, which has not been kept ia \\ndamp places, nor has been got from where the dis- \\nease prevailed. It is natural to suppose that the in- \\nfection would by such means be propagated. Nei- \\nther should the grain be placed too deep in the ground, \\nespecially where the soil is very fat or moist. When, \\nhowever, it is once begun, the plants diseased can- \\nB b 2 \\n\\n5«8 \\nPRINCirLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nnot be cured. In tender and scarce g\\'arden plants, \\nsomething may be done by amputating the diseased \\npart before its perfect formation. But, in general, \\nthis expedient is not adviseable. \\n} 340. \\nMutilatioyi happens especially in flowers, and* tlie \\nname flos mutilatus is used, when single parts of a \\nflower, particularly the corol, are not come to \\nperfection. The causes of this mutilation arc \\nunfavourable climate, and improper soil. Flowers, \\nnotwithstanding this mutilation, often bear perfect \\nseeds. \\nThe species of violet, Viola odorata and canlna, \\noften produce in our climate, if the weather is not \\nwarm enough, flowers wanting the corols. Campa-^ \\nnula hybrida has here no corols, but is said to have \\nthem in France and Italy. In several of the cam- \\npanulate flowers we see fi\\'equently the corol want- \\ning ; for instance, in Campanula pentagona, \\'perfo- \\nUatas media. Some other plants, as Ipomoea, Tus- \\nsilago, Lychnis, are liable to the same accident. \\nRueilia clandest\\'ma is thus called, because it has \\nsometimes flowers without the corols, sometimes \\nwith them. The same is said to be the case in its \\nnative country, Barbadoes. \\nHesperis mutronalis, during long-continued moist \\nweati^er, from superabundance of food, frequently \\nbears blossoms, where the corol becomes a second \\ncalyx. \\nThe Dianthus caryophyllus augments the scales of \\nits calyx so much, that the flpwer becomes somewhat \\n\\nDISEASES IN PLASTTS. \\n389 \\nlike the ear of wheat, and the corol never appears. \\nLess conspicuous is this disease, when a few stamens \\nonly are not so properly formed as the rule requires. \\n§ 341. \\nMonsirositm is the preternatural form of single \\nparts or a whole plant. In the flower and fruit the \\nmonstrosity is often such as to prevent their use en- \\ntirely. \\nThe stem is sometimes writhed, bent, knotty, too \\nmuch depressed, and in a lying posture. Cold cli- \\nmates in general make plants rough, small, and crip- \\npled. On high mountains the tallest trees are at last \\nreduced to a small size. \\nA monstrosity is sometimes observed in leaves by \\ntheir becoming deformed, either larger or more nu- \\nmerous, thicker, or frizzled. Every person has seen \\ntrefoil with four leaves, or the preternaturally red \\ncoloured leaves of the beech tree, and other varieties \\nbelonging to this class. \\nFruits likewise are variously deformed, they are \\neither very large or very small, grown together, \\ndistorted, crooked, and the like. These may, how- \\never, produce good seeds. But fruits which are \\ndoubled, where, when one is cut, a second one ap- \\npears in its interior, as sometimes happens in citron, \\nand fruits which have no seeds ; as for instance, the \\nBromelia A7ianas ; INfusa paradisiaca ; Artocarpus \\nmcisa ; Berberis vulgaris ; intirely fail us in the end \\nfor which they were intended by nature. \\nMonstrous flowers are of no value for the bo- \\ntanist, as their sexual organs are wanting, and he is \\nB b 3 \\n\\n390 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANr, ETC \\nunable without these to ascertain the genus. They \\nare only of sonrie imi)ortance to him, if they elu- \\ncidate any points in Physiology. They are particu- \\nlarly agreeable to garden amateurs, who have so viti- \\nated a taste, as to despise simple nature in all its \\nbeauty, and with care often transplant these defor- \\nmities into their gardens. \\nThe deformities in flowers are th^ following : — \\nFlos midtiplicatus, a double flower; F\\\\os plenus, a \\nfull flower ; Flos difformis, a deformed flower ; and \\nlastly, Flos prolijer, a proliferous flower. \\nFlos multiplicatus, a double flower, is the begin- \\nning of a full flower. Flowers are styled double, \\nwhen their petals exceed the usual number, but sta- \\nmens and pistil still remain to accomplish impregna- \\ntion, and to produce ripe seeds. The first begin- \\nning of a double flower is the corolla duplejc, or tri\\' \\nplex, when the corol becomes double or treble. Mo-^ \\nnopetalous corols are often double; for instance, \\nDatura; Campanula; but polypetalous corols still \\nmore frequently. As long as the pistil remains per- \\nfect in a flower, and it can bear seeds, so long the \\nflower is called double. The cause of this deformi- \\nty is the same as in the following. Very little care \\nis taken to remedy this evil, as gardeners, even like \\nto see full and double flowers. But if botanists wish \\nto see double flowers of herbaceous plants in their \\nnatural state, they ought by all means to give them \\nby degrees worse and worse soil. \\n\\nDISEASES IN PLANTS. \\n391 \\n§ 343. \\nFlos plenus. A full flower is that where the pe- \\ntals have become so numerous as to exclude both \\nstamens and style altogether. As such flowers want \\nthe necessary organs for impregnation, they will \\nnever be able to produce seeds. The full and double \\nflower both originate from too great richness of soil. \\nA number of vessels become stufted with nourishing \\nsap, in such a manner, tiiat the petals and stamens \\nsplit and are changed into more petals. Some flowers \\nare so full that the calyx bursts. \\nMonopetalous flowers are rarely full; such as, \\nPrimula ; Hyacinthus ; Datura ; Polyanthes. \\nPolypetalous plants are oftener full ; as, Pyrus ; \\nPrunus ; Rosa ; Fragaria ; Ranunculus ; Caltha ; \\nAnemone ; Aquilegia ; Papaver or Paeonia, and \\nmany others \\n$ 344. \\nFlowers which have nectaries in form of a spur ov \\nacup, usually increase the spur or cup, and lose \\nthe petals altogether, or they retain the last in \\ntheir natural situation. Or they lose sometimes the \\nspur or cup, and enlarge only the petals. \\nOf the first kind Aquilegia vulgaris, Narcissus \\nPseudo-narcissus, may serve as instances. In the \\n* Dianthus Caryophyllus and Papavcr somniferum have \\nbeen brought forward as fair instances to prove, that full \\nflowers may produce seeds. But this proceeds from confoundt \\ning a full flower with a double one. The last may bear seeds, \\nbut a full flower never, \\n\\n39^ PRINCIPLES OF BOTANT, ETC \\nAquilegia the petals are dislodged, and the spur only \\nincreased in number. In this case, then, many spurs \\nare endosed in one another like so many cornets. \\nIn Narcissus the {>etals remain natural, but the nec- \\ntarium is multiplied. \\nThe same plants Hkewise present instances of the \\nsecond kind ; in Aquilegia, the spurs are in this case \\nentirely wanting, and the petals increase in number ; \\nin the same way Narcissus may sometimes want the \\ni>ectarium, and the petals become full. The violet \\nand the larkspur become full in the same manner. \\nI 345. \\nFlowers which have one or a few stamens only, \\nare seldom full. When they are full, and this is ex- \\nceedingly rare, it is only in such plants as have a \\nmonopetalous corol. As an instance of this kind, I \\nshall mention Jasminum Sambac. Some of the na- \\ntural families never yet produced any double or full \\nflowers. Such are, \\nPalma£, (J 146, 1). \\nCalmariae, (ib. 3). \\nGramina, (ib. 4). \\nApetalae, flowers without petals. \\nAmeiitaceae, (ib. 50), \\nConiferae, (ib. 5i). \\nTripeialoidae, (ib. 5). \\nOrchideae, (ib. 7). \\nScitamineae, (ib. 8). \\nOleraceae, (ib. 12). \\nInundatae, (ib. 15). \\nBicornes, (ib. 18). \\nTricoccae, (ib. 38)» \\n\\nDISEASES IN PLANTS. \\n393 \\nStellatae, (ib. 47). \\nUmbellatae, (ib. 45). \\nAsperifoliae, (ib. 41). \\nVerticillatae, (ib. 42). \\nSome of the last, however, afford an exeeption. \\nIn those flowers which are styled Personatae, it has \\nbeen only observed in the species Antirrhinum. \\nThe papilionaceae, have been found full in a few \\ninstances only; as in Coronilla, Anthyllis, Clitoria, \\nSpartiuni. \\n§ 346. \\nFull flowers, as we have just now mentioned, oc- \\ncur most frequently in polypetalous corols, but the \\nmonopetalous are sometimes seen full, though this \\nwas formerly denied ; as instances are, Colchicum ; \\nCrocus ; Hyacinthus ; Polyanthes ; Convallaria ; \\nPolygonatum. The polypetalous corol becomes full \\nby its petals, the monopetalous by its laciniae. \\nFull flowers are somewhat of the appearance of \\ncompound flowers, and consequently may be mistaken \\nby the student for such ; but they are easily distin- \\nguished by the following marks : — 1. In the centre \\nof a full flower remnants of the style are still to be \\nseen. 2. Each petal is not furnished with stamens \\nor a style. 3. After they have blossomed, nothing \\nremains, and no fruit whatever can be traced. \\n4. Lastly, no common receptacle is to be found. \\n§ 347. \\nCompound flowers become full in a peculiar man- \\nner. Fiores semfflosculm, when they grow mature^ \\n\\n394 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nhave a very long germen and a pappus, which is as \\nlong again as the germen. Ihe lingniform corol, \\nstyle, and stamens are natural, but the stigma is \\ndivided, and of the same length with the corol. \\nSuch deformities occur in Scorzonera, Lapsana, and \\nTragopogon. \\nBy these characters, and by their never bearing \\nripe seeds, they may be distinguished from natural \\nspmifloscular flowers. \\n§ 348. \\nFlores radiaii Radiate flowers grow full in a \\ntwofold manner, either by the disk or centre, ( dis- \\ncus), or by the rays, (radii). If the disk is full, it \\nsuppresses the radii altogether, and the tubular corols \\ngrow longer, so as to get almost a club-shaped form, \\nand in this case the stamens are entirely lost ; e. g. \\nMatricaria, BelHs, Tagetes, &c. In the same man- \\nner, likewise, compound flowers become full, which \\nnaturally consist of tubular florets, for instance, Car- \\nduus. \\nFrom natural flowers of the same external ap- \\npearance, full flowers may be easily distinguished by \\nthe longer corol, and by the want of seeds. \\nIf the radius is full, then no disk can be seen, and \\nsuch a flower gets much of the appearance of the flos \\nsemiflosculosus, from which, however, it may be dis- \\ntinguished at once, by there being not the least ap- \\npearance of stamens. From the simple full flower \\nthe full compound flower differs in this point, that \\nthere is a style attached to each petal. The radius \\nof a simple radiate flower remains the same in a full \\n\\nDISEASES OF PLANTS. \\nS95 \\nradiate flower. If the radius is beset with prolific \\nfemale flowers, then the full flower, consisting of \\nmere linsfuifonn flowers, is provided with prolific \\nstyles, and may without difficulty, if there be any \\nnatural plants in its neigbourhood, come to bear \\nripe seeds. If the radius, on the contrary, consists \\nof barren female flowers, we commonly find them \\nto be the same in the full flower, \\n§ 345. \\nFlos difforniis, the diflbrmed flower, is not a full; \\nbut a barren flower, which in its appearance is un- \\nlike the natural plant. It occurs most commonly in \\nmonopetalous flowers. Some of the labiate and rin- \\ngent plants especially, belong to this kind, for in- \\nstance, Ajuga, Mimulus ard Antirrhinum. They \\ngrow sometimes longer than usual, assume the form \\nof egg-shaped corols, which are narrower at the top, \\nand divided into four lobes : several long spurs are \\nprotruded from their base, which in these flowers \\nare distinguished by the particular name of Peloria. \\nThe Antirrhinum Linaria very often affords this \\nvariety. \\nAnother species of difformed flower is the Snow- \\nball, (Viburnum Opulus). This shrub has, in its \\nnatural state, small campanulate flowers, which on \\ntheir margin are surrounded by large, unfertile, and \\nrotate flowers. In gardens and in rich soil, all the \\nflowers grow into large rotate corols, which are \\nthree times the size of the natural corols. All the \\ngtamens and styles vanish of course. \\n\\n396 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nAnother kind of deformed flower has been ob- \\nserved, though extremely rare In one of the Um- \\nbellatae, just beneath the umbella, a compound \\nflower was found resembhng that of Bellis perennis. \\n(Cf. Botanical Magazine, 1. Plate 2.) A flower \\nlike this was found by Gesner on a Ranunculus, \\n(Cf. Joan. Gesner, Dissert. De Ranunculo bellidi- \\nJhroy Tiguri. 1753, 4°.) It is singular to find on \\nthe stem of a flowering ranunculus and of an um- \\nbella, the flower of the Bellis. Once it was \\nthought, that the stems of both were grown togeth- \\ner, and that the stem of the Bellis had grown and \\nunfolded itself in the first like a grafted sprig. But \\nlate observations have shewn, that tliis flower is not \\nthe perfect flower of the Bellis perennis, but merely \\na congeries of many flowers of the ranunculus or \\numbella, imperfectly unfolded, which have retained \\ntheir small size and yellow colour, and are inclosed \\nin a number of whitish petals. Perhaps the bite of \\ninsects produces this deformity. \\n§ 350. \\nFlos prolifer. A proliferous flower is one flower con- \\ntained within another. This mostly occurs in full \\nflowers. They are of a double kind ; first, in simple \\nand in compound flowers. \\nIn simple flowers, a stem rises from the pistil, \\nwhich buds and flowers. This stem is scarcely ever \\ncovered with leaves, and seldom more than one \\nflower grows from another. Instances of this kind \\nare, the pinclove, the ranunculus, anemone, roses, \\nthe Geum 7ivale, and Cardamine praiensis. \\n\\nDISEASES OF PLANTS. 397 \\nThe deformity, however, is of a different kind m \\ncompound flowers For in them a number of stems \\nrise from the receptacle, which all bear flowers. \\nInstances of this deformity are, Scabiosa, Bellis, \\nCalendula and Hieracium. \\nIn the Unibellatae something similar has likewise \\nbeen observed, to wit, one umbel growing out of \\nthe other, or, what 1 once myself saw in Heracleum \\nSphondi/lium, the tall btem had on its extreme poiiils \\ngreen leaves and small umbels. \\nProliferous flowers are a great curiosity, but they \\nnever have perfect seeds. I saw it only once in \\na lemon, on the apex of which a stem rose with \\nanother lemon, I doubt indeed if there be any \\nproliferous fruits, the lemon excepted. \\nIn such fruits, however, when tne common recep- \\ntacle grows larger, an appearance like that of pro- \\nliferous fruits is often met with. I have repeatedly ob- \\nserved, in the Pinus Larix^ a proliferous strobilus. I \\nhave even seen a strobilus which produced a sprig, \\non wliich other strobili were formed. In the same \\nmanner proliferous spikes are formed in rich soil, in \\nSecale cereale, Phleum prataisCy Alopecurus pratet^ \\nsis, and the liJke. \\n351. \\nA very remarkable monstrosity in the germen ia, \\nthe Clavus in grain. The seed becomes swelled thr^e \\ntimes its usual size and thickness, but has no corcle. \\nThe clavus arises in the species of corn and gramina \\nfrom an unknown cause, by a stagnation of the ad- \\n\\n398 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY^ ETC^. \\nducent and air vessels. There are two distinct Spe- \\ncies of it : \\n1. The simple clavus, which is of a pale violet \\ncolour, in its interior is whitish and mealy, without \\nany smell or taste, and may be ground along with \\nthe sound grain, without any bad etfects on the \\nlast. \\n2. The malignant clavus, which is dark violet, \\nblue or blackish, internally has a blueish gray colour, \\na foetid smell, and a sharp pungent taste. Its meal \\nis tenacious, imbibes warm water slowly, and has \\nno siimy appearance when kneaded. The bread \\nhas a violet blue colour. When eaten, cramps, and \\nespecially the Raphania of Cullen are produced by \\nit. \\n§ 352. \\nSteriUtas. We call plants sterile or barren, when \\nthey produce neither flowers nor fruits. All full, de- \\nformed, and prolii^rous flowers, therefore, are sterile, \\nbecause the stamens and pistil suffer in them. But \\nsome plants are sterile only as far as they do not \\nproduce blossoms. The cause of this may be cli- \\nmate, too much sap, improper soils, and ill treat- \\nment. Plants, which are transplanted from a warm- \\ner climate into a colder, bloom very rarely. An \\nartificial degree of heat, like their natural, is there- \\nfore frequently tried, but not always with good eflect. \\nThe plants from the Cape of Good Hope require \\nmore warmth in winter than in summer, and if they \\nhave this are sure to blossom. Fruit trees, when \\nthey have too much sap, and their outer bark is too \\n\\nDISEASES OF PLANTS. \\nthick, have only a thin vascular rin2; annually form- \\ned ; the sap therefore must ascend towards the top \\nand the boughs, and fruit trees of that kind grow \\noften without ever iiavin^; blossoms. Gardeners try \\nto remedy this, by lopping some boughs, cutting off \\npart of the root, and by removing the plant to a \\nsterile soil ; but they are, notwithstanding all these \\nprecautions, often disappointed. The best and \\neasiest method is to bleed or scarify such trees, as \\nit has been called, or to scratch superficially, and \\nand in a winding direction, their stem and principal \\nbranches. The vascular rings are then at freedom \\nto expand, and the tree will bloom and bear fruits \\nwithout delay, as the circulation of the sap does not \\nnow go on with equal rapidity as before.

Ill treatment indeed sup- \\npresses in many a plant the approaching flower. \\nAmaryWis fo7i?wsissma, if kept constantly in pots, \\nfilled with garden earth, produces many leaves, but \\nno flowers.

When flowering plants, which are pro- \\nvided with perfect female organs of generation, do \\nnot bear fruit. This originates from a want of male \\norgans of generation, their bad structure, want of \\nthe impregnating insects, the heat of moisture and \\nsoil, sting of insects, and violent storms, various \\ndisorders, too great age and too much sap, or, last- \\nly, when the flower appears at an unfavourable sea- \\nson. Every botanic garden can shew us numberless \\ninstances of abortion. How often do we lose exotic \\nplants, bearing no seeds, because the male organs \\nare either wanting, or in an imperfect state ! How \\noften might insects, could we obtain proper species, \\ndo this office ! In this case, a great deal may be \\ndone bv the gardener. If there is not sufficient \\nwarmth, which is required, to ripen many foreign \\nfruits, they must necessarily drop off in its immature \\nstate.

HISTORY OF PLANTS- \\n§ 354. \\n!By the History of Plants, is to be understood the \\ninfluence of Climate on Vegetation ; the changes \\nwhich it is probable plants undergo from the revolu- \\ntions of our globe ; their dispersion over its surface ; \\ntheir migrations ; and, lastly, the means pursued by \\nNature for their preservation. \\n§ 355, \\nGeographers have imagined this globe to be sur- \\nrounded by certain Zones, and they have divided \\nthese into degrees and circles. They suppose the \\nhottest climate to be under the line, or at the Equa- \\ntor ; a hot climate under the Tropics ; between these \\nand the Polar circles, two different climates, a tem- \\nperate and a cold ; and, lastly, they consider, under \\nthe Polar Circle, a very cold climate to prevail. \\nUpon the whole, these divisions agree well enough \\ntogether ; but great dilTerences are produced by \\nmountains, valli^s, rivers, marshes, woods, seasy \\n4 \\n\\nHISTORY OP PLANTS. \\n403 \\nand inequalities of surface ; so that there are places \\nwhich, according to the above divisions, ought to be \\nwarm, which are however temperate, or even cold, \\nand vice versa. We must therefore distinguish be- \\ntween a physical and geographical chmate. Ameri- \\nca and Asia are much colder in the same northern \\ngeographical latitude than our part of the world. \\nPlants which in America grow under the 42d degree \\nof northern latitude, bear in our climate the cold of \\n52\". The reason of this great difference seems to \\nbe the enormous swamps and woods of America, \\nand the immense elevation of the land in Asia. \\nAfrica, under the Tropics, is incomparably warmer \\nthan Asia or America. The chains of mountains \\nin these last countries, and the humidity of the val- \\nlies, moderate the great heats, while the burning \\nsands, of which almost the whole of the African \\nsoil consists, increases the heat. The regions about \\nthe North Pole are much more temperate than those \\nat the South Pole. Tierra del fuego lies under the \\n55th. degree of Southern latitude, and has a much \\nmore inclement sky than prevails in Europe under \\nthe 60th. Mountains that raise themselves high \\nabove the clouds, have, in all latitudes, perennial \\nsnow upon their extremest summits. Cook found \\nsuch a mountain in the Sandwich islands ; and in \\nAmerica, the celebrated Andes have their tops co- \\nvered with perpetual ice under the Tropics and the \\nLine, while a constant summer is felt in the vat- \\nlies. \\nG c 2 \\n\\n40i \\nI\\'RIJfCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC* \\n§ 356. \\nSituation, ircat and cold, wet and dry soils, have \\ngreat influence on the whole of vegetation. It is \\nnot therefore surprising to find, in every region o-f \\nthe globe, plants adapted to each particular situa- \\ntion. Accordingly, when we meet on the tops of \\nhigh mountains the plants of Polar regions, we infer \\nthat these plants were destined for cold climates : \\nnor ought we to wonder that, under the same lati- \\ntudes in Asia, Africa, and America, we find, on \\nsimilar soils, plants which are native in all these \\nquarters of the globe. \\nIn one geographical latitude, if no mountains or \\nother circumstances change the temperature, the \\nsame plants are found to grow ; but places in the- \\nsame longitude, must ahvays exhibit various produc- \\ntions of the vegetable kincrdom. The Mark of \\nBrandenburgh) the coasts of Labrador and Kamt- \\nschatka, lie nearly under the same latitude^ and \\nproduce therefore many plants in common. Berlin, \\nVenice, Tripoli, and Angola, are nearly in the same \\nlongitude ; but their plants are very ditferent. \\n§357. \\nIt is well known that warmth is necessary tO\\' vege* \\ntation : hence it naturally follows, that in the warmer \\nclimates, the number of native plants M ill be most \\nconsiderable. The Floras, made by Botanists in \\ndifferent countries, shew, that vegetation increases \\naccording to the degree of lieat. In Southern Geor- \\n^m, by the best accounts, there are only two native \\n\\nHISTORY OF PLANTS. \\n405 \\nplants : in Spitzbergen, there are 30 : in Lapland, \\n.534: in Iceland, 553: in Sweden, 1299 ^ in the \\nMark of Brandenburg, 2000 : in Piedmont, 2800 : \\non the coast of Coroniandel, nearly 4000 : as many \\nin the island of Jamaica : in Madagascar, above \\n5000. In every region there are plants, except in \\nthe regions round the pole covered with perpetual \\nsnow, on the icy tops of the highest mountains, and \\nin the dry and sandy wastes of Africa. On tiie bare \\nand banen places where volcanic fires predominate, \\nthere are to be found few plants and those miserably \\nstunted ; as in the island of Ascension and Kergue- \\nlen\\'s land. \\n§ 358. \\nClimate influences the growth, as well as the form, \\nof every vegetable product. Tlie plants of the Po- \\nlar regions, and of high mountains, are low, with \\nvery small and close set loaves, but with flowers })ro- \\nportionally large. The plants of Europe have no \\nvery showy flowerSj and many of them are Catkins : \\nthe Asiatic climates are particularly rich in splendid \\nflowers : the African plants have, for the most part, \\nvery succulent leaves and variegated flo^^\\'ers. Ame- \\nrican plants are remarkable for long snuooth leaves, \\n.and the singular structure of their flowers and fruits. \\nThe plants of New Holland are distinguished by \\nthin dry leaves, and a more compressed form. Those \\nof the Archipelago in the Mediterranean Sea, are \\nin general shrubby and prickly. The plants of Ara- \\nbia ar€ of a low and s\\'tuntcd growth. In the Canary \\nislands, the most of the plants, and even genera tiiat \\nc c 3 \\n\\n40^ \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANV, ETC \\nin Other climates are herbaceous, become cither \\nshrubs or trees. \\nThe resemblance between the trees and shrubs of \\nnorthern Asia and America is remarkable, though \\nthe herbaceous and perennial plants of both thosft \\nparts of the world have almost nothing in common, \\nwith respect to form. The following comparative \\nlist will make this apparent : \\nIn northern Asia groto \\nAcer cappadocicum \\nAcer Pseudoplatanuf! \\nAzalea pontica \\nBetula davurica \\nAlnus glutinosa \\nCorylus Colurna \\nCrataegus sanguinea.

May we not suppose an agreement \\nin respect of soil or situation, at the creation of or- \\nganic bodies, to have produced the resemblance \\nwhich w-e here discover ? \\nIn cold climates, the plants of the class Crypto- \\ngamia are most numerous ; there are some tetrady- \\nnamious, umbelliferous and syngenesious plants; \\nbut few trees or shrubs. \\nIn warm climates are found most trees and shrubs, \\nmany Filices, twining, parasitical, succulent, and \\nliliaceous plants, Bananas and Palms. Herbaceous \\nand annual plants vegetate only in the rainy season. \\nThose w ith pinnated and strongly veined leaves are \\nfound chiefly in tropical countries. \\nAquatic plants, while they remain under water, \\nhave their leaves finely divided ; but when they rise \\nabove the surface of the water, the leaves become \\nbroad, rounder, and at the base more or less emar- \\nginated. \\nPlants that grow in elevated situations are the re- \\nverse, with respect to the form of their leaves, of \\nthose that grow in water. Their radical leaves are \\nmore or less intire ; but the stem leaves, the higher \\nc c 4 \\n\\n408 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nthey rise, are always the more minutely divided. \\nExamples of this we have ia the Scabiosa Colujnba- \\nT\\'lUf Valeriana, &c. \\nf 359. \\nPlants in their wild state remain pi-etty constant \\nin their appearance, though they vary sometimes ; \\nbut these variations are inconsiderable, in compari- \\nson of what they undergo when they become objects \\nof culture. It is remarkable, that both plants and \\nanimals are no sooner domesticated than they begin \\nto change their shape, their colour and taste. Al- \\npine plants, or those of the polar regions, become, \\nin vallies or gardens, very much larger ; their leaves \\nincrease in length and breadth, but their flowers \\ngrow smaller, or at least do not increase. The \\nplants of warm countries have so different an ap\\' \\npearance from that they have with us, that an inex- \\nperienced botanist does not know them in their na- \\ntive places. How endless are the varieties we fjncj \\nour orchards and kitchen gardens ! \\nJ 360. \\nNow, whence comes the great number of distinct \\njjlants which our earth produces ? Were these all \\ncreated originally, or have new species appeared \\nsince, in consequence of mixture with one another? \\nIt is difficult to give a satisfactory answer to these \\nquestions. Linnasus, and some other botanists have \\nsupposed, that nature originally formed nothing but \\ngenera, and that the species were produced after- \\nwards by the mixture of these. This hypothesis, \\n4 \\n\\nIIISTOIIY OF PLANTS. \\n40} \\nhowever, seems untenable. In our days, we ought \\nto see new species formed by the mixture of various \\ngenera, and experiments would confirm the fact. \\nIf it was possible for the infinite power whicli called \\nevery thing into existence to create genera, why \\nshould it not also have formed species ? We find \\ntoo much harmony, too much uniformity in nature, \\nand see so much consistency in the machinery of it, \\nto doubt that the wise creator of tlie whole did not \\ngive at the beginning to all organized bodies the \\nforms we now see them in. Many genera of plants, \\nhowever, of which in some countries there are very \\nnumerous species, may perhaps, by mixture, have \\nproduced a new one. We find, for instance, at the \\nCape of Good Hope, of the genus Erica, nearly \\ni^OO species, of Stapelia above 50, of Ixia and Gla- \\ndiolus 58, of Protea above 70, of Mesembryanthe- \\nnium about 1 80, not to mention other genera which \\nlikewise contain numerous species. The great re- \\nsemblance between some of these, which makes it \\ndifficult to find characters to distinguish tiiem by, \\ngives some colour to the supposition. \\nWe have already mentioned, (§ 301) that fertile \\nhybrids arc not uncommon in the vegetable kingdom. \\nAV\\'e find this occurrence in our gardens, and cannot \\ndeny that it may sometimes happen in the fields. \\nNature, however, has wisely provided, that in a \\nwild state^an intimate nnxture cannot easily take \\nplace in plants. Those that nearly resemble one \\nanother, we find growing in very distant regions, \\nilowerinfT at dilFcrcnt times, or placed in dissimilar \\nsituations, It is only congenerous plants that can \\n\\n410 \\nPIUNCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nmix and produce hybrids ; nor can even that happen, \\nunless many species of a genus grow in a given spot. \\nLet us give an example of this position. We have, \\nin this neighbourhood, three species of Scrophula- \\nria growing wild ; namely, the Scrophularia vernat \\nnodosa, and aquatica. The first grows about the \\nvillages in hedges, and flowers in the spring; the \\nsecond is found in moist pastures, and flowers a \\nmonth later : the third grows in rivers, marshes and \\npondSj and flowers a month later than the second. \\nOther species of this genus, which resemble the \\nabove, grow in Italy, Siberia, in the East, in North \\nAmerica, &c. By none of these can any spurious \\nbrood be produced in their native situations. But if \\nwe bring all the foreign and indigenous species of \\nthe genus together, and place them in a Botanic Gar- \\nden, would it be sur[)rising if, in a soil to which they \\nare not accustomed, some should flower sooner and \\nsome later than is natural to them, and by the addi- \\ntional means of the insect tribe, flying from one to \\nanother loaden with impregnating pollen, a hybrid \\nshould appear among them ? We shall soon find \\na number of plants that never originally grew wild, \\nbut owe their existence solely to Botanic Gardens. \\nThe numerous varieties of our fruits have certain- \\nly had their origin in this spurious method of im- \\npregnation, and perhaps some that pass for species \\nhave been produced in the same way. To me, it \\nSeems not improbable that Pyrus dioica, Polheria, \\naud pruni/\\'o/ia, pwe their existence to such niix- \\nJtures, \\n\\n.HISTORY OF PLANTS. \\n411 \\n§ 361. \\nBut were it even doubtful whether new plants \\nwere ever produced by mixture, we have perhaps a \\nstill more important conclusion to draw from the \\nobservations every day made, that great changes \\n. have formerly taken place in our globe, and much \\nwreck been made of its vegetable produce. \\nThe plains and secondary mountains, contain \\nwithin them a large quantity of petrified bones, shells \\nand animals. In schistus and sand-stone, there \\nare impressions of various plants. These all pro- \\nclaim the revolutions which our globe has undergone. \\nBut how was this powerful catastrophe brought a- \\nbout, or when did it happen? To these questions \\nwe want proofs to enable us to return a satisfactory \\nsmswer, and must be content to confess our igno- \\nrance. \\nMeanwhile, however, naturalists have not been \\nidle. They have carefully collected the remarkable \\nsymbols of former times, and compared them with \\nthe organic productions of the present. At first they \\nexpected to find many of these again ; but they were \\nunable to explain how it was possible for the Ele- \\nphant, the Rhinoceros, and Hippopotamus to live and \\nprosper in our climates, and in the cold of Siberia ; \\nor how Palms and various f ilices could inhabit our \\nnorthern regions. They endeavoured by many an \\ningenious hypothesis to account for this ; but some \\nof these were contradicted by the discovery of new \\npetrifactions; and otiiers had so little probability, \\n\\n412 \\nPRINCIPLES OP BOTANr, ETG. \\nthat they went counter to all the known laws of na- \\nture. \\nEnquirers, however, were at last convinced, by \\nmany observations, that the petrified remains of \\nanimals, as well as the impressions of plants, be- \\nlonged to subjects not now to be found alive on our \\nglobe. \\nCuvier possesses a number of the remai\\'^s of qua- \\ndrupeds which do not now exist. By Conchology \\nwe learn that those bivalve shells, which are found \\nin a petrified state, are never to be met with recent : \\nand the beautiful Filices we see in schistus, the \\ntrunks of trees which are changed into coal, or petri- \\nfied wood, even in the frigid zones, where cold suffers \\n110 tree to grow, are now no where to be found in a \\nlivins; state. - \\nAccordingly, the most celebrated naturalists, as \\nBlumenbach, Batsch, Lichtenberg and Cuvier, with \\nmany others, have drawn this highly probable con- \\nclusion, that at least one creation has been lost, and \\nthat the present organic world is a new formation. \\nThey leave to the Natural philosopher, and As- \\ntronomer to account for these stupendous phenome \\nna ; but they believe that, perhaps the brilliant nim \\nbus of tlie Sun, to whose benign influence we are \\nso much indebted, may at long intervals be increas- \\ned or diminished, nay, in certain periodical and \\nstated times, be intircly extinguished ; and that then, \\nas at first, by the returning splendour of the Sun, \\nacting on the ruins of tiie former creation, and the \\nfermentation of the elements, another new one may \\niinse. The periodical brightness and Auatness of \\n\\nHISTORY OF PLANTS. \\n413 \\nthe hght of some of the fixed stars, and the total \\ndisappearance of some of them which once shone \\nwith great splendour, seem to confirm the above \\nopinion. \\nCut though these remains of pristine animals and \\nplants, have been preserved to our times, still it is \\ncertain that their originals are not now to be found ; \\nand that our chronology is not sufficient to ascertain \\nthe period when changes so eventful have taken \\nplace. \\n§ 362. \\nWith respect to the plants at present existing on \\nour globe, experience shews that mountainous places \\nare richer in vegetables than plains, and that where \\nthere are primitive mountains, the number of plants \\nis more considerable than on secondary mountains. \\nA country where there are primitive mountains, has \\npeculiar plants, which are wanting where there are no \\nsuch mountains. We find upon all plains in the \\nsame latitude, however extensive they may be, the \\nsame plants without any other difference, tl>an \\nwhat arises fi om the difference of soils. Upon the \\nprimary mountains, and at their feet we meet again \\nwith all the plants of the plains. We find where \\nhigh chains of the primary mountains skirt the plains, \\nthaJL all the plants of the plain are fourid at the bot- \\ntom, and even up their sides. If we pass over the \\nmountain and come to a new plain, another vegeta- \\ntion appeai-s, which we again find at the feet of the \\nsucceeding chain. From the enumeration of plants \\nmade in diti\\'crcnt countries of Europe, and of other \\n\\n414 TRINCIPLES OFBOTAXr, ETC. \\nlegions, we find this abundantly proved. Who \\nthen can doubt that the plants of all valleys have been \\nderived from high mountains, and that the primary \\nones of our globe are the source of the Floras of \\nevery different country ? Hence it is that America \\nabounds so much in plants, being intersected from \\nthe North to the South Pole, by high chains of \\nmountains with their numerous branches. Hence \\nCanada produces other plants than Pensylvania, \\nthis others than Virginia, this again others than Ca- \\nrolina, and Carolina others than Florida, and so \\nforth. Hence it is that the North-west coast of \\nAmerica nourishes very different plants from the \\nNorth-east coast, the South-west coast different plants \\nfrom the South-east coast. Islands that are flat, \\nhave all the plants of the neighbouring continents ; \\nbut if they contain high mountains, they are not \\nunfurnished with the plants that grow on those. \\nThus, though according to these observations no \\ngreat changes had happened to the plants at present \\nexisting, every hypothesis that should maintain \\nthe remains of the vegetable kingdom to be still ex- \\nisting plants, would be destitute of probability. \\n§ 363, \\nMay not the sea have formerly been more extend- \\ned over the globe than it is at present ? Perhaps the \\nearth consisted at first of a vast watery plain, broken \\nonly by chains of high mountains, and the depth of \\nthe sea might be smaller. On these mountains ex- \\nisted the vegetation gf the present land. The sea \\n\\nHISTORY OF PLA^TS. \\n415 \\nmight chuse itself a deeper bed, the mountain would \\ndecrease and the firm land by degrees appear, which \\nwould gradually be sown with the plants of the \\nmountains and the vallies. Here and there the sea \\nmight leave large lakes of salt water, which would \\ngradually dry up, and leave l)ehind the hard rock \\nsalt. This bed of salt would, according to circum- \\nstances, by the waves of the sea or by high winds, \\nbe covered with earth, or with mud convertible into \\nhard stone. The shore of the sea nourishes, as is \\nwell known, its own peculiar plants, which flourish \\nin a soil abounding with salt, but perish wliere there \\nis none. In the neighbourhood of these beds of \\nsalt, the shore plants would find sufficient nourish- \\nment and increase. Subterraneous springs of fresh \\nwater would flow over these salt beds, and being im- \\npregnated with the fossil would appear as salt springs- \\nThe shore plants would here find plenty of nourish- \\nment, and would propagate rapidly. This appears \\nto be the origin of salt springs, and perhaps accounts \\nfor the appearance of the shore plants in their \\nneiirhbourhood. We accordingly find near salt \\nsprings, in the interior of Continents, the following \\nplants of the sea shore, which are no where else to \\nbe met with, viz. Salicornia /fer^^m/, Poa distam, \\nPlantago maritma, subiihita, Glaux maritima, \\nSamolus Vakrandiy Aster Tr\\'ipolium, acris, and \\nmany others. \\nI 3()4. \\nWhen in this way, perhaps after a long succes- \\nsion of years, as we suppose, the land was gradual- \\n\\n41(5 \\nPRIN\\'CIPLES OF BOTAXV, ETC. \\nly formed, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes \\nmight again destroy large tracts, and change the \\nform of the land, by which means a number of \\nplants might be destroyed that afterwards might \\nnever appear again. We find most plants growing \\nin their native places plentifully; but there are some, \\nas may be inferred from what is just said, that have \\nnever been found but on one particular spot. For \\ninstance, Thunberg found on the Table mountain, \\nat the Cape of Good Hope, and in one place only, \\nthe Disa longicomis, and Serapias tabularis, and \\nnever afterwards observed them elsewhere. Tour- \\nnefort gathered from a single rock of the small is- \\nland Amorgos in the Archipelago of the Mediterra- \\nnean, the Origanum Tournefortii, Sibthorp, who \\nmade the same journey long after him, found that \\nplant no where except on that very spot. \\nCountries that are now separated by the ocean \\nmight formerly have been joined, at least the plants \\nthey have in common, authorize the supposition. In \\nthis way might the most northern part of America \\nhave been connected with Europe, and New Hol- \\nland with the Cape of Good Hope ; thus too the \\nisland of Norfolk might have been joined to New \\nZealand, kc. For North America produces several \\nof the smaller European plants, and in New^ Hol- \\nland grow some of the plants peculiar to the Cape \\nof Good Hope. In like manner New Zealand, \\nwhich has a Flora quite different from that of the \\nneighbouring continent of New Holland, possesses \\nmost of the plants that are found on Norfolk island, \\nparticularly the New Zealand flax, Phormiiim tcnax. \\n\\nHISTORY OF PLANTS. \\n417 \\nOf this more examples miglit be produced if we had \\nroom for them. \\n§ 365. \\nBesides the manner in which we have said it is \\nprobable that plants have been dispersed over the \\nglobe, there are other circumstances that have con- \\ntributed to spread some plants to a distance they \\nwould not otherwise have reached. Many seeds \\nare furnished with hooked prickles, which take hold \\nof the hair of animals, and are thus transported to \\na distance. Birds go in search of various seeds, and \\ndrop them often many miles off. The seeds of many \\naquatic plants cling to the feathers of birds that \\nfrequent the waters, and quit them when they alight \\nin places far remote. \\nThe seeds of most plants when perfectly ripe \\nsink to the bottom in water. If they are contained \\nin a hard shell they remain a long time fresh. Some \\nfeet deep under ground, and at the bottom of the \\nsea, some plants will remain long in a state fit for \\nvegetation. At these depths no air can reach them, \\nand protected from the access of this, they are not \\ndestroyed. \\nIt appears too that rivers and seas may transport \\nplants to far distant places. Ripe and fresh seeds \\nfrom the West Indies are sometimes thrown on the \\nshores of Norway. Were the climate of that coun- \\ntry fit for such plants, Coco nuts and other plants \\nof the torrid zone would be planted and prosper. \\nThe seeds of the service tree are carried to remote \\nplaces by our rivers. Many German plants have \\nDd \\n\\n418 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANV, ETC. \\nbeen obsei-ved on tlie coasts of Swe(ien, many Spa- \\nnish and French on the shores of Brittiin many, \\nAfrican and Asiatic on tlie shores of Italy. \\nThe wind carries the seeds that are furnished with \\ndown, with wings or menibi\\'anaceous riins, as also \\nthose that have swollen capsules, to |)lace3 convenient \\nfor their gennination. By this means too, some \\nplants that have light seeds are scattered in the tract \\nof the prevailing winds, and carried to places they \\nwould not otherwise have reached. The wind car- \\nries the winged seeds of the Birch, (Betuia alba), to \\nthe tops of towers and high rocks where they often \\ngerminate. The Birch is likewise by reason of its \\nlight seeds dispersed over northern Asia, hither \\nthe heavy acorns of the Oak, (Quercus Robur), can- \\nnot follow them. \\nMany seed-capsules and fruits burst with an elas \\ntic force, and scatter their seeds round about, while \\nothers are obliged to remain in the places wherc they \\nare produced, particularly such as ripen under \\nground. The pistillum of some plants, after flow- \\nering, turns down, and pushes itself into the earth, \\nwhere the seeds come to perfection. Examples of \\nthis are found in Arachis hypogaea, Glycine subter- \\nTrifolium subterraneim, Lathyrus amphic&r- \\njp€s, Vicia subterraneA, Cyclamen, &c. Berries, and \\nall succulent fruits cannot disperse themselves ; they \\nfall to the ground, and their soft skins nourish the \\nyoung plant. Many birds and other animals feed \\non these ; they carry them aVv^ay, and having eaten \\nthe succulent part, let the seeds drop, or the seeds \\njmss uninjured through their intestinal canal, and ai\\'^ \\n\\nHISTORT OF PLANTS. \\n419 \\nthus propagated. In this way the Misletoe, (Viscum \\nalbum), is sown by a bird, tiie Missel-thrush, (Tar- \\ndus viscivonis), and thus also the Juniper (Junipe- \\nrus communis). \\nBut man himself has done more for the dispersion \\nof plants than winds, or seas, or rivers, or animals. He \\nwhom all nature obeys, who changes the wilderness \\ninto fertile fields, who lays waste whole countries \\nand again restores them, has, in various ways, pro- \\nmoted the dispersion of plants. \\nThe wars which nations wage with one another ; \\nthe migrations of different people ; the pilgrimages \\nto Palestine ; the travels of merchants, and trade it- \\nself, have brought to us great numbers of new plants, \\nand have carried our plants to many distant regions. \\nAlmost all our garden vegetables have been brought \\nfrom Italy and the East ; and the most of our grains \\nhave come to us from the same quarter. By the \\ndiscovery of America we have received different ve- \\ngetables, which formerly were unknown to us, but \\nwhich are now common. \\nThe thorn apple (Datura Stramomwn), that is now \\nknown over almost all Europe, the cold countries of \\nSweden, Lapland and Russia excepted, as a poison- \\nous plant, was brought to us from the East Indies, \\nand was so generally dispersed, by means of Gypsies, \\nwho used the seeds of it medicinally as an emetic \\nand cathartic. \\nThe kidney-bean, (Phaseolus vulgaris), the Pha- \\nseolus nanus, Impatiens Balsamina, and the Panicum \\nmiliaceum (millet) were likewise brought from the \\nEast Indies. \\nDd 2 \\n\\n420 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nBuck-wheat, the most of our grains and pulse, have \\ncome to us from the East through Italy. \\nAppleS; Pears, Plumbs, Cherries (Prunus avium J, \\nMedlars (Mespilus gennanica), Crataegus tormina- \\nlis, and the hazel nut, are originally German plants. \\nIn warmer countries, they are, however, much more \\ndelicious. The numerous varieties of these to be \\nfound in our gardens we have received from Italy, \\nGreece and the Levant. \\nThe horse-chesnut, (Aesculus Hippocastamim), \\naccording to Clusius, came to Europe from the North \\nof Asia in the year \\\\550. The Crown Imperial, \\n(Fritillaria imperialis), we received first from Con- \\nstantinople, in the year 1570. \\nAfter the discovery of America, many plants from \\nthat country have been naturalized in this. The po- \\ntatoe was first described in 1590, by Caspar Bau- \\nhin; and Sir Walter Raleigh, in the year 1523, brought \\nit first from Virginia to Ireland, whence it has been \\ndistributed over the whole of Europe. \\nThe Oenothera himnis was first introduced by the \\nFrench, on account of its esculent root, in 1674; \\nsince which time it has grown so common, that it \\ngrows wild in almost every country of Europe in \\nhedges and about the villages. \\nTobacco (Nicotiana Tahacumjy was first described \\nby Conrad Gesner in 1584. In the year 1560 it \\nwas brought to Spain, and in 1564, to France by \\nNicot, a French ambassador. \\nColeworts and other plants of that sort were \\nbrought from Greece to Rome, whence they were \\nspread over all Italy, and at length reached us. It \\n\\nHISTORY OF PLANTS. \\n421 \\nwould be tedious to trace the migrations of all the \\ncultivated plants at present in use. It is sufficient \\nto mention a few of them. \\nWith the different kinds of corn, likewise, many \\nplants have been introduced, which are now natu- \\nralized. Such as, the blue bottle, (Centaurea Cy \\nanus J, the corn-cockle, (Agrostemma Githago), the \\nwild Radish (Raphanus Raphamstrum), the com- \\nmon Myagrum (Myagt\\'um sativum), and many others. \\nThese plants are only found among corn, and are \\nnever seen on waste places where there are no corn- \\nfields. In the same w^ay, at the introduction into \\nItaly of Rice, (Oryza satkaj, from the East Indies, \\nmany plants have been observed that grow only \\namidst the Rice. This plant was first raised in Italy \\nin 1696. \\nThe Europeans, in establishing colonies in various \\nparts of the world, have carried along with them all \\nour culinary plants. By this means many European \\nvegetables have been introduced into Asia, Africa \\nand America, and where the climate would al- \\nlow it, have spread themselves over these coun- \\ntries. \\n§ 366. \\nNature is always busy in making one plant take \\nadvantage of the protection of another ; she like- \\nwise provides for the propagation of seeds in many \\nvarious ways. Lichens and mosses are destined for \\nthis purpose in cold climates, the rainy season in \\ntropical countries, and storms and changes of wea- \\nther ill the polar regions. In our climate, besides \\nI) d 3 \\n\\n422 \\nPRINCIPLES OF Bpi\\'AWy, ETC. \\nlichens and mosses, there are conimonly three tem- \\npestuous periods that assist th^ dispersion of seeds \\nand plants, namely in Spring, in the middle of Sum- \\njner, and in Autumn. These, besides the important \\npurpose of purifying the atmosphere, have one of \\ngreat advantage to the vegetable kingdom. In \\nSpring they dispose the seeds that have continued \\nthrough the Winter to hang on the stems of plants : \\nin the midtile of Summer they carry to a distance \\nthose that have grown ripe in the Spring, and in \\nHarvest those that have come to perfection in Sum- \\nmer. Moles and dew-worms and earth-worms, hav- \\ning perforated the soil ami fitted it for the reception \\nof these seeds, a heavy rain forces them into it, and, \\nby the benign influence of the Sun\\'s rays, at the pro- \\nper period they germinate. It is easy to imagine, \\nthat, in this way, many seeds may be brought to \\nplaces which are not fit for their reception, and thus \\nperish : On this account the wise Author of Nature \\nhas provided the annual plants with a much greater \\nnumber of seeds than would otherwise have been \\nnecessary. A single plant of Turkey corn (Zea \\' \\nMays), bears 3000 seeds ; the Sun-flower, (He^ ; \\nlianthus annuiis), 4000 ; the Poppy (Papaver som- \\nmferum), 32,000, and lobacco (Nicotiana Taba- \\ncwnj, 40,320; but of so great a number sonxe must \\nnecessarily fall on convement places and be propa- \\ngaied. \\nNaked rocky places, on which nothing can grow, \\nare, by the winds, covered with the seeds of Lichens, \\nthat by nieans of the accustomed showers in Har- \\nvest and Spring are induced to germinate.

On \\nthis meagre soii the seeds of masses are accidentally \\ndriven, where they gern^ioate. They grow and pro* \\nduce a pleasant green tuft, which, in time, isi fit for \\nthe reception of the smaller plants. By the rotting \\nof the mosses and small plants, there arises a thia \\nlayer of earth, that in course of tiuae increases, and \\nthen heconies fit for the growth of various shrubs \\nand trees, tiU at last, after n^ny years, wbere for- \\nu^eily there was nothing but naked rocks, the eye of \\nthe traveller is gratified with the sight of extensive \\nwoods of tlie most beautiful trees. Such is the pro- \\ncess of Nature ! Gradual, great, and constantly con- \\nducive to general good are her operations. Mosses, \\nand Lichens inapirove in a similar manner tliie dry and \\nbarren sands. The plants that grow naturally in \\nsuch soils have almost all creeping and extensively \\npenetrating roo.ts ; or they are succulent, and draw \\nmoisture from the atmosplijere. By means of these \\nplants the sandy soil is made fit for the reception of \\nmosses and lichens, and afterwards changed into \\ngood and fertile earth. \\nMosses cover the stems and roots of trees : they \\nhave this particular property, that in warm weather \\nthey wither, and in wet weather revive again. \\nThey readily attract moisture and maintain them- \\nselves in the rugged interstices of the bar^. From tlte \\ntree they draw no nourishment ; this tliey receive \\nintirely from the atmosphere. In wintei\\' they pro- \\np d 4 \\n\\n424 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC: \\ntect the tree from cold, in wet weather from corrup- \\ntion, and in dry weather, they impart to it their \\nmoisture, and they protect the stem and the root \\nfrom the burning rays of the Sun*. \\nBut the use of mosses is greater still. In them \\nplants and trees will grow as well as in the best garden \\nsoil. Gleditsch brought many fruit trees to perfec- \\ntion in musses alone. Some kinds of mosses grow \\nchiefly in wet and marshy places, as the turf moss \\n(Sphagnum palustre). Stagnant waters and ponds \\nhave their surfaces covered with them, and are after- \\nwards, by the marshy plants, that grow there, con- \\nverted into meadows and fields. According to Ta- \\ncitus, the whole Hercynian forest was once a marsh, \\nthough now, in the places described by him, there \\nare fertile fields and meadows. Aged husbandmen \\nin our neighbourhood can remember places, where \\nformerly there was nothing but stagnant water, which \\nare now converted into fertile fields, and rich mea- \\ndows. \\nThe property of mosses to attract moisture occas- \\nsions their growing most plentifully in wet places. \\nThe tops of mountains are covered with a profusion of \\nthem, which draw towards them the moisture of the \\nclouds ; the clouds thus jittracted, and in which the \\ntops of mountains are almost constantly involved, \\nprevent their being able to retain all the moisture, \\n* Mosses and Lichens, are prejudicial only to young trees \\nwhere the bark is still actlTC ; but mosses, when they are very \\nlong, may, by retaining a superabundance of moisture, be \\nhurtful eien to growa trees. \\n\\nHISTORY OF PLANTS. \\n425 \\nwhich therefore sinks into the clefts and crevices, \\nwhence it proceeds from all sides to the lowest plage, \\nand at last appears in the form of a spring. Many \\nsmall springs unite and form a rivulet, which in its \\nprogress swells to the size of a large stream. Thus \\nto the apparently insignificant mosses, are we indebt- \\ned almost intirely for the mightiest rivers, and to \\nthem moreover do we owe the desiccation of exten- \\nsive swamps, and the fertility of the most unfruitful \\nsoils. \\nThe object of nature is not only the maintenance \\nof every plant, but the turning to use even the de- \\ncaying parts of every vegetable and animal produc- \\ntion. The smallest space is destined to be the abode \\neither of a plant, or of an animal. The richest and \\nmost barren soil, the dry sand, the naked rock, \\nthe highest Alps, the deepest morass, the bottom \\nof rivers, of ponds, and of the ocean, nay, the \\ndarkest cavities under ground, such as mines, pro- \\nduce their peculiar plants. Putrescent animal sub- \\nstances are attacked by mucors, and small fungi, \\nwhich accelerate their destruction, and convert them \\ninto earth, to afford soil and nourishment to other \\nplants. Thus the leaves, the stems, the wood, and \\ndifferent parts of vegetables become a prey to these \\ndestructive fungi, which complete the process of \\nputrefaction. What appears to be nothing but deso- \\nlation and death, is the theatre of a new world in \\nminiature. Every created thing serves for the good \\nof the whole. \\n\\n4S6 PRIXCIPLE^ OF BOTANY, ETC. \\n{ 368. \\nThe plants of fresh water are more widely dis* \\npersed than those of the land. Water moderates \\nthe heat and cold of climates, and hence many \\nEuropean aquatic plants grow also in wajm coun- \\ntries. The common Duck-meat, (Lemna mimrj, \\ngrows not only over all Europe and North America, \\nbut is found also in Asia. It has been observed in \\nPennsylvania, Carolina, Siberia, Tartary, Bucbaria, \\nChina, Cochin-China, and Japan. The Bulrush, \\n(Typha latifolia), grows over Europe, North Ameri- \\nca, in Jamaica, in Siberia, China, and Bengal. The \\ngreat number of water-fowl that yearly migrate, by a \\nmost wonderful instinct, from a colder country to \\na warmer, occasions the wider dispersion of aquatie \\nplants. The most of these plants perfect their seeds \\nat the season when the birds are preparing to set \\nout on their journey. The seeds stick to the fea- \\nthers, they are also sometimes swallowed by the \\nbirds, and afterwards passed without injury. \\nI 309. \\nThe plants that grow at the bottom of the sea are \\nfound in all regions, because the vicissitudes of heat \\nand cold are never felt at the bottom, which is gene- \\nrally every where of the same temperature. The \\nFucus natans, a very common sce^ plant, and which \\ngoes by the name of Sargazo, or Sea-grass, is found \\nas well under the Equator as under the Poles. As \\nthe marine plants are very numerous, many of them \\nare to be found every where, with this difference \\n1 \\n\\nHISTOHY OF PLANTS. \\nonly, that spme require a more concentrated saUness \\nof the water or ^ moveable bottom.

Nay the common alpine plants, \\nth^t is, those that are found on the Alps of Europe \\nand Asia, seem to follow the line of perpetual snow, \\n^nd are met with on the plains in Greenland, Spitz- \\nbergen, Lapland, Nova Zembla, northern Siberia, \\nm>d Kamtschatka, while in the warmer regions they \\nkeep on the summits of the iiigliest Alps. On the \\nmountains of Siberia, Lapland, Norway, Scotland^ \\nand Switzerland, on the Pyrenees, on the Apennine \\nand Carpathian Alps, as well as on the smaller \\nmouuLainous chains of Germany, as in the Hartz, in \\nThuringia, in Silesia, and Bohemia., there are many \\nplants that ai\\'e common. For instance, the dwarf \\nBirch, (Bjetula nana), is found on them all, the Sibe- \\nrian, Apennine, and Carpathian Alps excepted. \\nMay not this communion of some plants, which can \\nooly be (^ispersQd by lii^wa^ of winds, of birds, and \\n\\n428 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY\", ETC. \\nOther circumstances, be a proof of a former con- \\nnexion ? Tournefort saw at the foot of the mountain \\nArarat, the plants of Armenia, higher up those com-, \\nmon in France, still higher those of Sweden, and at \\nthe top the alpine plants, which are found at the \\nNorth Pole. Similar observations have been made, \\nbv other travellers, on mount Caucasus. \\nOn the mountains of Jamaica Swartz found no \\nEuropean alpine plants, but many common Euro- \\npean mosses, such as Funaria hygrometrica, Bryuni \\nsejyyUifoUumx caespititium, Sphagnum pahistre^ Di- \\ncranum glaucum, and many others. We know that \\nthe seeds of mosses are so small as to be invisible to \\nour eyes, and that it requires a high magnifier to en- \\nable us to see them. We know too that they swim \\nin the air; may they not, therefore, have been \\ndriven thither by the winds, and, finding a convenient \\nclimate, have there generated ? at least no other \\nway of accounting for their appearance occurs to \\nme. \\nPerhaps the seeds of some Lichens that grow \\nin warm climates may be brought by the winds to \\nus, and by reason of our unfavourable climate grow, \\nbut bear no fruit. This appears to be the case with \\nthe Lichen caperatiis, which is found in the south of \\nEurope, as in Provence, Italy, &c. on the stems of \\nthe Olive trees, and on the stakes that serve for the \\nsupport of the vines, and almost never without the \\nfructification ; while with us, where it is so common, \\nit never hears any. \\nBut when the two Forsters found on Tierra del \\nFuego, the Pinguicula alpinay Galium Jparirw, \\n\\nHISTORY OF PLANTS. \\n429 \\nStatice Armeria, and Ranunculus lapponicus, tliey \\nmight well find it difficult to say how these plants \\narrived at the furthest corner of the world. It may be \\nquestioned, therefore, whether the great resemblance, \\nthat these plants bore to those of Europe, did not \\nmislead our great naturalists, in taking them for the \\nsame, as they might have distinguishing characters \\nwhich, for want of comparing them M\\'itb the Euro- \\npean species, they did not suppose. When Lin- \\nnaeus and other botanists state varieties of a plant \\nto exist in different zones, they are not always to be \\ntrusted ; for I have often seen that such varieties \\nhad more constant characters than many which are \\nby them made species, and that they really did con- \\nstitute true species. Why should not Nature, in \\ndifferent degrees of latitude and longitude, have \\nformed species that exceedingly resemble one an- \\nother ? \\nJ 371. \\nIn all countries there occurs a remarkable cir- \\ncumstance in the history of plants, namely, that \\nsome grow gregariously, and some single; that is, \\nsome always grow numerously and close together, \\nwhile others are scattered and lead a sort of retired \\nlife. The reason of this singular circumstance ap- \\npears to lie in the seeds themselves, which are either \\ntoo heavy for the wind to carry away, or too light so \\nas to be destroyed by it, or the elasticity of the cap- \\nsule is not strong enough to throw them to a \\ndistance. The root too of some vegetables is creep* \\n\\n430 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\ninw, SO th^it many plants of such must always stand \\ntogf^ther. \\nThe gregarious plants sometimes occupy great \\ntracts of ground. The common heath, (tlrica vttl^ \\ngarifi), extends often for many miles. The whortle- \\nberry, (Vdccinium AJyrtillus), the straw-berry, \\n(Frelgaria vesca), some species of Pyrola, various \\nrushes, (J unci), and some trees are of this kirid. \\nSolitary plants are the Turritis gtahra, Anthericum \\nJLiliago, Lychnis dioica, and many others. But when \\nplaces are very populous, men have made great altera- \\ntions in this respect, by planting woods, and bringing \\nplants close together that would have stood separate, \\n8tc, The dift\\'erence between gregarious and solitary \\nplants is of consequence to those who generally do \\nnot regard it. We give here for instance mosses \\nwhich the forester and the economist trouble them- \\nselves less about than they ought. Gregarious \\nmosses are the Sphagnum palustre, Dicranum glau- \\ncum, Polytrichum commune, and many others. The \\nsolitary are, Polytrichum piliferum, all the species \\nof Phascum, Weissia paludosa, 8^q. \\nJ 372. \\nPlants, like animals, are confined to certain lati- \\ntudes. Many natives of warm countries can by de- \\ngrees accustom thetnselves to our climate, and even \\nto those that are colder. Under shrubs are more \\neasily reconciled to a warm than to a cold or even a \\ntemperate climate. In high latitudes there falls at \\nthe beginning of winter a deep snow, that does not \\nmelt till the return of spring, after -which no nit^ht \\n\\nHtStOftr OF PLANTS. \\n431 \\nfrosts are td be expected, and the air of which is but \\ntt dfcgree of temperature above the freezing point. \\nIn temperate climates it often freezes strongly with- \\nout sno# havirtg previously fallen, and thus the \\nplants ate killed. By this means the Polar and \\nAlpine plants, which in their native places are cover- \\ned with snow, are frozen with us, where frosts with- \\nout sno\\\\V^ are frequent. It is only those under- \\nshrubs and annual plants of warm countries, which \\nrequire a longer time for pushing their shoots and \\nflo^^ers tlian the short summer of a cold climate \\npermits, that cann<:>t here be inured to the open air, \\nand those vv hich require a great degree of heat. \\nBut trees and shrubs seem to be more sensible of \\ncold, because their perennial trunk is raised high \\nabove the ground, and thus sooner suffers by the \\nvicissitudes of the weather. Some that are natives \\nof warm climateis have become naturalized with us, \\nperhaps because their cellular texture is tougher \\nthan tliat of other plants ; but, on the contrary, \\nthere are many, that in this respect are unaccommo- \\ndatin**, because tlieir or\";anization will endure no \\ngreat alteniation of heat and cold. \\nBut the moat useful plants, like the domestic ani- \\nmals, are capable of succeeding in very different \\nclimates. If there are some which are confined to \\ncertain zones, there are others in those regions \\nwhere these cannot live, to supply their places. \\nUnder the Equator and within the Tropics in similar \\nisiituations our kinds of grain do not prosper; but, \\ninstead of them, there are the Rice, (Oryza satha), \\nIndian Corn, (Holcus SorgkumJ, atid Turkey corn, \\n\\n432 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\n(Zea Mays), which are proper substitutes for our \\ngrain. In Iceland and Greenland neither our corn \\nnor that of the tropical regions will grow ; but na- \\nture has provided for these countries the Elymus \\narenarius in abundance, which in case of necessity \\nmay be used as Rye. \\nIn no cold climate are there wanting esculent \\nroots and pulse. Of these many grow wild which \\nremain untried, but of which necessity, if we had \\nnot received our garden plants from the East, would \\nhave taught us the use. All our kitchen-garden \\nplants are so obedient to the variations of climate, \\nthat they have followed the footsteps of men to \\nalmost every region. \\n5 373. \\nFrom what has been said, it may naturally be in- \\nferred that, after so many and such various changes \\nas plants are subject to, it cannot but be difficult to \\nascertain the exact point from which each has origi- \\nnated. We shall, however, endeavour to fix some- \\ntliing with regard to those of our part of the world, \\nbecause with these, particularly in the northern part \\nof it, we are better acquainted than with others. As \\nto Greece, we must pass it over, because in a bo- \\ntanical point of view it is almost wholly unknown to \\nus. Its Flora, however, seems to originate in the \\nSardinian Alps, the coasts of Asia and Africa, and \\nthe islands of the Archipelago. According to our \\nformer position, plants have descended from the \\nhighest mountains to the plains, and we here assume \\nfive principal Floras for Europe, namely, the \\n\\nHISTORY OF PLANTS. \\n433 \\nNorthern, the Helvetian, the Austrian, the Pyre- \\nnean, and the Apennine. \\nThe Northern Flora proceeds from tlie Norwe- \\ngian, the Swedish and the Lapland Alps. These \\nnourish in common the plants of the high northern \\nlatitudes. The mountains of Scotland seem former- \\nly to have been connected with those of Norway, \\nf6r the same plants grow on both. \\nThe Helvetian Flora takes its origin from the \\nSwiss^ the Bavarian and the Tyrolese Alps. The \\nmountains of Dauphiny, and those of Bohemia and \\nSilesia are only lateral branches of the same chain. \\nAll contain a great number of the same plants. \\nThe Austrian Flora originates in the Austrian, the, \\nCarinthian and Steyermark Alps. The Carpathian \\nmake a part of the same chain. \\nThe Pyrenean Flora arises in the Pyrenees. \\nThe mountains of Catalonia, Castile and Valentia \\nare parts of them. \\nThe Apennine Flora is derived from the Apen- \\nnines, and these send off many secondary bran- \\nches. \\nThe Helvetian Flora takes up the greatest space. \\nThe whole of Germany, with exception of the \\nAustrian circles and Moravia, Prussia, Poland, all \\nFrance, except the southernmost part of it, the \\nNetherlands and Holland produce the same plants. \\nThe Northern Flora extends over Denmark, \\nSweden, and Russia, and partly over England. \\nThe Austrian Flora stretches from the circle of \\nAustria over Moravia, the southern part of Poland, \\nHungary, Moldavia, Wallachia, Bulgaria, Servia, \\nEC \\n\\nPKINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nBosnia, Croatia, Sclavonia, Istria and Dalmatia. \\nTiie Pyrencan Flora occupies all Spain, the is- \\nlands of Majorca and Minorca, perhaps also Portu- \\ngal, but here our information fails. \\nThe Apennine Flora extends over the whole of \\nItaly, Sardinia, Corsica, and a part of Sicily. \\nIf we make a Catalogue of the plants of these \\nfive different Floras, the local distribution of them \\nwill be very remarkable. \\nIt is also easy to imagine that various mixtures \\nof the different Floras must have taken place after \\nthe firm land was formed and settled. This is the \\nreason why the south of France, where the Helve- \\ntian and Pyrenean Floras mingle, is so rich in \\nplants ; In Piedmont the P3Tenean, the Helvetian \\nand the Apennine Floras meet, and thither also, by \\nmeans of tlie sea, are the plants of the North of \\nAfrica brought. For the same reason Great Britain \\nconsists partly of the Northern and partly of the \\nHelvetian Flora, and in Cornwall, the most south- \\nern point of the kingdom, the plants of the Pyren- \\nean Flora, by means of the oblique position of the \\nSpanish coast, are mixed with the others. Sweden, \\nDenmark and Russia have not maintained the North- \\nern Flora pure ; many plants of the Helvetian have \\nfound tlieir way thither. The same may be said of \\nGermany, and particularly of our mark of Branden- \\nburg, where, besides the Helvetian Flora, we have \\nreceived a part of the Northern. From the North- \\ncm we have certainly acquired the IMalaxis LoeselU, \\nNeottia rcpens, Helonias borealis, Vaccinium O.zt/- \\n■eoccos. Ledum palustrcy Andromeda polifolia, Lirw \\n\\nHISTORY OF PLANTS. \\n435 \\niiaea borealis, and many others : From the Helvetian \\nFlora the following, Chironia Centaurea, Euphorbia \\nCj/parissiaSj Cucubalus Otites, and the most of our \\nplants. \\nIt is very remarkable that two such common plants \\nas the Euphorbia Ci/pdtissias and Cucubalus Otites \\nshould disappear about twenty German miles from \\nBerlin towards the North, and are not again to be \\nmet with, though they prosper perfectly well in the \\nnorthern botanic gardens. Perhaps these plants \\nwill in time sow themselves further north, and pro- \\nceed by degrees in the same direction. Who will \\nsay that they have not advanced in a greater degree \\nduring the last centuiy, that many plants have not \\nalso extended themselves in the same way, and that \\nthe Flora of Berlin has not acquired new species iti \\na course of years? \\nPlants that increase much by seed> and at the \\nsame time by the root, must be consequently the \\nmore widely dispersed ; it is not therefore surprising \\nthat several of these are found over all Europe, \\nfrom one end of it to the other. Those plants too \\nthat have light seeds which the winds can easily bear \\naway, are more easily disseminated than those vvhose \\nseeds are heavy. Some plants therefore of the for- \\nmer description, have travelled from Lapland to \\nthe extremest point of Italy, nay, even to the North \\nof Africa. \\nThe northern parts of Asia possess many of the \\nplants of Eui0[)e. We see towards the north, the \\nNorthern Flora, towards the South, the Austrian, \\nfind between tliese the Helvetian conspicuous. It \\nK e 2 \\n\\n435 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nwould seem that the European mountains had been \\nsooner provided with soil, and that this had been \\nlate in takin^r place on the Asiatic mountains, or \\nthat very little soil had covered the mountains on \\nthe North-west coast of Asia, It is no wonder then \\nif, even to tlie Uralian and Altaic chains of moun- \\ntains, the plains on this side have few Asiatic, but \\nmany European plants. \\nNorth America produces very many of the small \\nEuropean plants, which for the most part are those \\nof the Northern Flora. It is therefore probable \\nthat at some former period, there had existed a con- \\nnection between both the old and new worlds, which \\nin later times has been broken. \\n§ 375. \\nIn order to form a just idea of our proposition \\nwith respect to the dispersion of the vegetables \\nof our globe, we must travel over all the high primi- \\ntive Alps,, collect the Flora of each particular moun* \\ntain down to its bottom, and in the neighbouring val- \\nlies, but we must not descend into the plains. Were \\nEurope investigated in this manner, we would be \\nable to determine, according to the number of \\nplants found existing there, how the dispersion must \\nhave happened, and how the plants of this or of \\nthat chain of mountains have found their way to the \\nplains. \\nThe sea shores do not always indicate the Flora \\nof the interior. Upon the coasts we often find plants \\nthat have been brought from the neighbouring re- \\ngions. For this reason Asia, Africa, and America \\n\\nHISTORY OF PLANTS. \\n457 \\nwith Ml the tropics possess many plants in common, \\nwhich they have obtained from the shores of the \\nneighbouring countries. But if we travel farther into \\nthe interior of those parts of the world, these plants \\nalmost intirely disappear, and each of these portions \\nof the globe exhibits to us its own indigenous produc- \\ntions, which are the more numerous, if many ranges \\nof mountams, with a loose soil, be in the neighbour- \\nhood. \\nAt the Cape of Good Hope, we see around a \\nFlora so rich, so peculiar, and so little mixed, be- \\ncause the place itself is a mountainous region, \\nMadagascar possesses a numerous Flora, because \\nthat large island is very mountainous, and two quar- \\nters of the world, namely, Africa and Asia, between \\nwhich it lies, communicate to it their various produc- \\ntions. The Bahama islands are indebted for their \\nrich Flora, to tiieir own mountains and the neigh- \\nbouring countries. We there find not only indi- \\ngenous plants, but the most of those of Carolina, and \\nFlorida, and very many inhabitants of the West In- \\ndies and of the Mexican gulph. \\nTo find a plant existing as indigenous in all lati- \\ntudes would be difficult. Such plants as are found \\nwidely dispersed, have been planted by the hand of \\nman. The Chick weed (Alsine media J, which Lin- \\nnaeus and others affirm to be found every where, is \\nmet with only in those places to which our culinary \\nplants have been conveyed. - I do not find it \\nmentioned by the Indian botanists, although I be^ \\nEG 3 \\n\\n438 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nlieve it might grow in India; but in the warmer \\nplaces of Africa, I doubt much if it would exist. \\nAn extensive habitat has been assigned to the \\ncommon Nightshade (Solanum nigrum), and the \\nStrawberry (Fragaria *vesca). But naturalists have \\ntaken similar plants for varieties of the common \\nEuropean species, and have ascribed to those men- \\ntioned a much more extensive residerice than they \\nreally enjoy. The plants of the coasts have been \\nmore widely dispersed by nature, than those of the \\ninterior. Among these the Purslane (Portulaca ok- \\nracea ) ; the Sow-thistle (Sonchus olei^accus ) ; and \\nthe Cellery (Apium graveoleus) ; are the only ones \\nthat have wandered far : but even of these the two \\nlast have not been met with in the warmest regions \\nof the globe. \\nI doubt, however, if among the numberless plants \\nwhich our Earth produces, there may be any of so \\naccommodating an organization as to endure every cli- \\nmate, as in the animal kingdom, man, the dog and \\nhog do, which we know will prosper from the torrid \\nto the frigid zones. \\n\\nVIII. HISTORY OF THE SCIENGJE. \\n§ 377. \\nBotany, as a branch of Natural History, has only \\nlately attained that degree of perfection in -which we \\nnow see it Though the scientific knowledge of the \\nancients deserves great praise, yet they were very \\nlittle acquainted with Natural History. A botanist \\nof that time scarcely deserved the name. The whole \\nknowledge of plants consisted in a few very unde- \\ntermined names, merely preserved by tradition. \\nHowever, as man soon after began to feel the ne- \\ncessity and the utility of a juster knowledge of na- \\nture, more attention was paid to tiiis point. Great \\ncare especially was taken to give proper appellations \\nto the diiferent organic parts, and to direct the at- \\ntention even of those who were not studying the \\nscience, to this important branch of natural know- \\nledge. After the art of printing, so favourable for \\nscience, was invented, figures of plants began to be \\nengraved. These first drawings of plants Were only \\ncut in wood. Plants which have a striking difference \\nfrom others may easily be distinguished in this way \\nE e4 \\n\\n440 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nbut riiore delicate plants, which have some resem- \\nblance to others, will scarcely ever be distinctly enough \\nrepresented by figures of that kind. The best we \\nhave are from Rudbeck, Glusius, G. Bauhin, andDo- \\ndonaeus. The art of engraving in copper, became \\ngoon very important for botany It enabled philoso- \\nphers to make the knowledge of plants of more ge- \\nneral use. The neatest plates are those of Linnaeus \\nin the Hortus Cliffortiaims, of Smith, Cavanilles and \\nL\\'Heritier. Some botanists gave engravings like \\ncuts, representing only the outlines of the whole \\nplant. Such we have in Plumicr, and the works of \\nthe younger Linn^. To procure plates in a still \\nless expensive manner, some botanists put printer\\'s \\nink upon plants, which were dried, and then threw \\noff the impressions. Such representations are, no \\ndoubt, very accurate, but the finer parts of the flow- \\ner are always entirely lost. The best impressions of \\nthat sort we have from Junghans and Hoppe. Of \\ncoloured plates those of Roxburgh, Masson, Smith, \\nSowerby, Trew, and Jacquin, are the best. \\nOf a botanist we require in our times an accurate \\nand thorough knowledge of all wild growing plants, \\nfrom the largest to the smallest moss ; a complete \\nknowledge of all the parts of a plant, and of the bo- \\ntanical terms ; lastly, an intimate acquaintance with \\nall the natural families of the vegetable kingdom, \\nand with the properties, peculiarities, and different \\nvirtues of plants. In common life we give the name \\nof a botanist to him, who gives us good representa- \\ntions of plants, and knows to distinguish some by \\ntheir external characters. But the first has no mc- \\n\\nmSTORY OF THE SCIENCE, \\n441 \\ntit whatever, and his work can only deserve our ap- \\nprobation as tlie production of an artist, if his draw- \\nings of plants are well executed. Nor can the other \\npass for a botanist, as he is unacquainted with the \\nsmaller plants, such as algae, mosses and fungi. It \\nis not the simple knowledge of plants that makes the \\nbotanist. A botanist compares his plant with all \\nknown ones, looks for the distinguishing features, \\nand observes attentively nature in general. Nomen- \\nclature alone can indeed never afford us real plea- \\nsure, whereas careful observations will furnish us \\nwith abundant facts for further investigation. The \\nbotanist likewise points out to the physician, farmer, \\nforester, and ai\\'tist, all useful plants, and without \\nhim they never can make any certain and just ex- \\nperiments. \\nThe history of botany then shews us the gradual \\nprogress which man has made in the knowledge of \\nthe vegetable kingdom. To take a view of it with \\nmore facility, we shall divide it into several epochs. \\n^ 378. \\nFIRST EPOCH. \\nFrom the first origin of the Science till the time, \\nof Brunfels. \\nThe first inhabitants of our globe w^ere in the ve- \\nry beginning of their existence obliged to get ac- \\nquainted with those fruits only, which sufficed to satisfy \\ntheir moderate desires. Experienqe soon taught \\n\\n442 \\nPRINCIPLES OF BOTANT, ETC, \\nthem, that some plants were very noxious to man. \\nOnly those and the few which they used as food, \\nwere known to them. But as soon as they began to \\ndisperse here and there, and to require more ne- \\ncessaries, they were obliged to seek for other ali- \\nments. Several diseases, the natural consequences \\nof a violation of the laws of nature, obliged them to \\nlook for remedies, which they luckily discovered in \\nthe vegetable kingdom, either by accident, or through \\nanimals. Thus the inhabitants of Ceylon learned \\nthe use of Ophiorrhiza. A small animal, (Viverra \\nIchneumon ), which feeds on poisonous serpents, eats, \\nas soon as bitten by one of them, the root of this \\nplant. The Ceylonese having observed this, tried it, \\nand found it an excellent remedy against such a bite. \\nIn like manner became the Americans acquainted \\nwith the use of Aristolochia anguicida and Serpent \\nria. Thus the knowledge of some medicinal plants \\ncommenced. The father shewed them to the son, \\nthe son to the grandson, and so forth. By tradition, \\nthe only means at those times of preserving things \\nfrom oblivion, their names were communicated to the \\nfarthest generations. \\nIn the East, at first the only seat of erudition, the \\ngreatest care was taken to acquire a knowledge of the \\nbeneficial or noxious qualities of different natural pro- \\nductions. The Chaldeans communicated their know- \\nledge to the Egyptians, and these to the Greeks. \\nIn Greece, where indeed real science first orisi- \\nnated, Aesculapius attempted, by means derived from \\nthe vegetable kingdom, to cure some diseases. But \\nmedicine scon became intimately connected with re- \\n\\nHISTORY OF THE SCIENCE. \\n443 \\nligion. In the temples dedicated to the worship of \\nthe gods, the prescriptions of Aesculapius were pub- \\nlicly hung up, and the priests alone undertook the \\nexamination and the search of officinal plants, and the \\ntreatment of different diseases. They were, as fol- \\nlowers of Aesculapius, called Asclepiades. \\nThe father of medicine, Hippocrates, added to the \\nobservations of Aesculapius a great many of his own, \\nand first published several works on medicine. In \\nhis writings, the diseased and the healthy state of \\nman are very fully treated of, and in speaking of the \\nmethods of cure, he has mentioned about 234 plants. \\nBut these are only names. Hippocrates was born \\n459 years before Christ, at the island Cos. He \\nlived to a very old age, though, as to that, authors \\ndiffer, some saying he lived to be 89 years old, some \\n90, others 104, and a few indeed 109. The plants \\nhe mentions can scarcely be guessed at, for though \\ngreat natural philosophers and linguists have attempt- \\ned, long ago, to fix them properly, notwithstanding \\nall those endeavours, they still remain very doubtful. \\nCratevas or Cratejas, was a cotemporary of Hip- \\npocrates. Cratejas is said to have been very well ac- \\nquainted with all the herbs and roots of Greece. His \\nwork, entitled \\'Pi^otojuUov, has been almost entirely \\nlost, which is much to be regretted, because, most \\nprobably, the different plants mentioned in the cure \\nof diseases by Hippocrates, were more accurately \\ndescribed by him. In the Imperial library at Vien- \\nna, as I am told, some single fragments of this worl^ \\nQre still preserved. \\n\\n44)4 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC. \\nAristotle first undertook, at the ex pence of Alex- \\nander the Great, to wnie a coirjj)lete natural liistoiy. \\nThis philosoplier, iiowever, has paid more attention \\nto the other kingdoms of nature than to the vegeta- \\nble kingdom, lie lived soon after Hippocrates. \\nTheopljiastus was born at Lresus, in the island \\nof Lesbos, about 300 years before Christ. Though \\nhe lived upwards of 85 years, he still complained of \\nthe shortness of human life. He was a pupil of \\nPiato and Aristotle, and so great a favourite of the \\nlast, that he became the heir of his library, and his \\nsuccessor in the peripatetic school. Of all those \\nwe have named, he was best acquainted with bo- \\ntany. In his work* he has given us the descriptions \\nof more than 500 plants. They are, however, only \\nofficinal plants, the use of which he has very accu- \\nrately explained. \\nThe Romans, likewise, after their victory over \\nMithridates, began to study this branch of natural \\nhistory. \\nAiarcus Cato w rote, 149 years before Christ, on \\nmedicine, and the remedies used in it. \\nMarcus Terentius Varro lived at the time of the \\nemperor Augustus, and wTote chiefly on country \\naffairs. \\nPedanius or Pedacius Dioscorides, born in Asia, \\nat Anagarba in Cilicia, paid extreme attention to the \\ninvestigation of the medical powers of the vegetable \\n* Ui^i (pvTov Irra^Ms. There are a great many Latin transla- \\ntions of this work; the last is Theophrasti Eresii Historia \\nPlantanim.

His work* contains the descriptions of \\nmore than 600 plants. He made many and exten- \\nsive journeys tlirough Asia. Dioscorides lived under \\nthe emperor Nero, 64 years after Christ. \\nCaius Piinius Secundus flourished at nearly the \\nsame time. He collected the most important passages \\non all parts of natural history, from the writings of \\nIjis predecessors, but especially used the works of \\nDioscorides in his writings on plants. Pliny has \\nmade no discoveries himself From his Uthtohis \\n19th book he treats on plants. He says, strangely \\nenough, that there are many more plants growing \\nnear hedges, public roads, and in fields, but that \\nthey have no names, and are of no use. In his 66th \\nyear he became the sacrifice of his curiosity and in- \\nquiries into the nature of things, attempting to wit- \\nness an eruption of Vesuvius. \\nSeveral Roman authors wrote on plants, but wha^ \\nthey have left are merely transcripts from other \\nauthors. \\nExcept the works of some Asiatic writers, as Ga- \\nlenus, Oribas-ius, Paulus Aegineta, and a few other \\nphysicians, nothing more was written on the produc- \\ntions of the vegetable kingdom. And indeed even \\nthese authors give us nothing else but mere lists of \\nnames, which are of no use whatever. \\n* Ht^tvMf <<«T5<*??, or De Materia mcdica, Lib. VI. It was \\nfirst published by A.

But \\nthey mention only the officinal plants of older writers. \\nA long pause now happened, during which science \\nwas, as it were, entirely asleep. The few scattered \\nw ritings on medicine and natural history were mere \\ncompilations from old authors, decorated with the \\npedantic learning of monasteries. Thus botany was \\nalmost forgotten till in the l6th century a German, \\nof the name of Brunfels, roused this science from \\nits lethargy* \\n§ 379. \\nSECOND EPOCH. \\nFrom Brunfels to Caesalpinus; \\nFrom 1530 to 158S. \\nIn the last epoch, little or nothing was dond in \\nibotany during a space of some thousand years. \\nWith the catalogues of about 60() plants, a foun- \\ndation was laid, but no prospect whatever of the \\nstructure to be erected upon this foundation. \\nThis second period indeed presents us with more \\npromising views. All science begins to revive, and \\nmonasteries arc no longer the exclusive seat of hu- \\nman knowledge. Brunfelsius, Gesner, Fuchsius, \\nDodonaeus, the ever memorable Clusius, and the \\ngreat Bauhin opened the path. \\nOtto Brunfelsius, son of a cooper, was born at \\nMaynz, at the end of the 15th century. He was first \\na Carthusian friar, and became soon after cantor, (pre- - \\n\\ntllSTORY OF THE SCIENCE. \\n44f \\ntentor), in Strasburg. After he had Hved there about \\nnine years, he applied with so much success to the \\npractice of medicine, that he got an invitation to \\nBern, where he practised about a year and a half \\nwith general approbation, but on the 23d of No- \\nvember, 1534, he died there, lamented by the whole \\ncity. In his work* he has given the first figures of \\nplants, and he was also the first botanist in Ger- \\nmany. The drawings are not very good, and do \\nnot in the least correspond with his own descrip- \\ntions. \\nHieronymus Bock was born at Ileidesbach iu \\nZweybruecken, 1498. He lived there for some years, \\nbut went afterwards to Hornbach, where he became \\nclergyman and physician at the same time. He died \\nin the 56th year of his age, the 21st of June, 1554. \\nHe changed his name, according to the fashion of \\nhis age, to the Greek name Tragus. In three books \\nof his work* he treated pretty accurately of those \\n* Otto Brunfels Historia Plantarura, Argentorati, Tom. I. \\nand II. 1530; Tom. III. 1536.

We have, besides, an edition of it published \\nat Frankfort, 1546, in fol. ; and one in Strasburg, 154.?, \\nin 4to. The works of Brunfels are very scarce.

It is an objection made to him that he ne- \\nglected the virtues of the plants, though he knew \\nthem perfectly well, and that he used the writings \\nof the ancients too litde. \\nEuricus Cordus was born in a small village in \\nHesse, and died 1538. He taught and practised \\nmedicine in Erfurt, JMarburg, and Bremen. Ac- \\ncording to the general opinion, he was one of the \\nmost learned men of his age. He wrote several \\ntreatises on plants, especially those described by the \\nancients*. \\nHis son Valerius Cordus was born 1515, and was \\nunfortunately, when on his way to Rome, 1544, \\nkilled by a horse. His worksf are rare, and the \\neditions of Dioscorides which he published are still \\nthought valuable. \\nConrad Gesner, the greatest polyhistorian of his \\nage, was born at Zurich, 1516, and died there 1565. \\nHe has written on several branches of natural his- \\ntory, botany, and physic. His works are as under J. \\n* Eurici Cordi Botanologicon, sive Colloquium de herbis. \\nColoniae. 1534. 8vo.

Tlie em- \\nperor, Charles the Fifth, esteemed him very highly, \\nand honoured him in various ways. He wrote a \\nhistory of plants, of which many editions have ap- \\npeared iu German, French, and Latin \\'j ; he likewise \\nwrote notes to Dioscorides, Galen, and Hippocrates, \\non which account he entered into a long dispute with \\ntlie famous physician and philologist, John Heynbut \\nor Ha^enbut, ^^ ho likewise called himself Cornarus. \\nCornarus published a treatise against him, entitled, \\nVulpecula excoriata. Fuchsius answered in another, \\nwith the title, Cornarus furiens; after which Cornarus \\nfinished the dispute with the publication of a work, \\nwhich he termed JVIitra, s.

His Nymphaea \\nlutea minor scptentrionalium is an ill represented \\nfigure of the Nymphaea m\\'mima lately discovered \\nin Germany. The second is to be attributed to \\ncarelessness, as he trusted too much to his memory, \\nand hence often imagined he had seen a plant in \\nBritain, which he, in fact, had met with in other \\ncountries. \\nCharles Clusius, or Charles de TEclu^d, was born \\nat Artois or Atrecht, in the Netherlands, 1526. His \\nparents wished him to become a lawyer, and he went \\nwith this design to Loewen. But he soon changed \\nhis mind, and, from his great love to botany, soon \\nundertook the most tedious and troublesome journeys \\nthrough Spain, Portugal, France, Great Britain, the \\nNetherlands, Germany, and Hungary. In his 24jtli \\nyear he already became dropsical, of which however \\nhe was cured by the use of succory, recommended \\nto him by the famous physician Rondeletius. In his \\n39th year, in Spain he broke his right arm close \\nabove the elbow, falling with his horse, and soon \\nafter he had the same accident with his right thigh* \\nIn his 55th year, in Vienna he sprained his left foot, \\nand eight years afterwards dislocated his hip.

The great pain and dif- \\nficulty he had thus to suffer when walking, pre- \\nF f 3 \\n\\n452 PRINCIPLES OF BOTANY, ETC \\nvented him from taking the necessary exercise, in \\nconsequence of which he was affected with hernia, \\nobstructions in his abdomen, and calculous com- \\nplaints. Thus miserable and unhealthy, tired of \\nthe court of the emperor, where he had resided \\nfor fourteen years, and finding besides the su- \\nperintendence over the gardens there too great \\na burden, he accepted in the year 1593 an in- \\nvitation as Professor at .Leyden, where he died \\nApril 6, 1609. Clusius was the greatest genius of \\nhis age, and prosecuted the study of botany with \\nan enthusiastic zeal and a perseverance which was \\nnot equalled by any preceding philosophers, that of \\nany of his followers. His works * exhibit the great \\nbotanist, and they will alwa\\\\\\'s remain valuable and \\nindispensably necessary. The figures annexed to \\nthem are neat, the drawings correct, and his descrip- \\ntions masterly. It was a pity that a man of so great \\nmerit, should have suffered so much, and even be- \\ncome the first martyr to botany. \\n§ 380. \\nTHIRD EPOCH. \\nFro7fi Caesalpinus io Caspar Baumfn. \\nOr from 1583 to 1593. \\nIn this epoch Caesalpinus makes the first attempt \\nto bring botany under a systematic form.

He fixes new \\ngenera, endeavours to bring the smallest plants, as \\nmosses and fungi, under a certain classification, and \\nfirst clearly points out the sexes of plants. What \\nVaillant was unable to do, to arrange the mosses \\naccurately and justly, has been ably executed by \\nDillenius and Micheli. Linne\\'s great genius gives \\nthe whole science a more favourable appearance, \\nand botany now becomes, what it should have been \\nlong before, a structure resting upon a firm foun- \\ndation. \\n* Louis Fcuillcc Journal dcs observations physiques, ma- \\nthematiques ct botani(jues, faitcs p.ijr ordre du Iloi, sur les \\ncotes orientales dc I\\'Ameriquo mcridionale.

He studied surgery, but his great \\nlove for botany induced him to study this science \\nexclusively. Tournefort, whose pupil he was, did \\nevery thins in his power to complete the education \\nof his very promising pupil. He became demon- \\nstrator of botany at Paris. From too great a zeal for \\nbotanical knowledge, he travelled on foot through \\nall the neighbourhood of Paris, and thus became \\nconsumptive, which put (May 21, 1722), an end to \\nhis active life. \\nThe smaller plants became the chief object of his \\nattention. He recognised in the pollen of the Pa- \\nrietaria the semen masculinum, and did not, with \\nTournefort, consider it merely as an excrementi- \\ntious matter of the flower*. \\nHeinrich Bernhard Ruppius, a student at Giessen, \\nwas born to be a botanist. He travelled through \\nthe greatest part of Germany on foot, content with \\npoor sparing diet, often sleeping in the open air. \\nHis knowledge of plants was far more than superfi- \\ncial, and he often even distinguishes plants by their \\nstamens, and enumerates many new genera f. \\n* Sebastian!

Linn^ spent liis academi- \\ncal life under a great many hardships, and in great \\npoverty. Celsus, professor of divinity at Upsal, and \\nKudbeck, at last began to favour him. He travelled \\nat the expense of the academy through Lapland, gof, \\nafter his return, acquainted with tiic daughter of Dr \\nMoraeus, afterwards his wife, who presented him \\nwith money to go to Holland to take his degree. \\nBoerhaave recommended him to Dr Cliffort, of \\nwhose garden and herbarium he had full use, and who \\nsent him for a short time to England. After Rud- \\nbeck\\'s death he became professor of botany at Up- \\nsal. The king made him baronet, and at last archi- \\nater, and knight of the order of the Polar Star. He \\ndied January 8, 1778. Linne\\'s works are too nume- \\nrous for us to mention them all, it will suffice to \\nnotice the last and best editions of his principal \\nworks *.

This whole century may, with regard \\nto natural history, justly be called the century of \\ndiscovery. It must however be admitted, that, did \\nphilosophers really wish to make their writings more \\ngenerally useful, they would make their works less \\nexpensive, and not give us repeatedly copied plates, \\nuhich only renders the study less attainable. Besides, \\nwe are so unfortunate since Linne s death to get new \\nplants under different names, and to see new names \\ngiven to plants already known. Should this anarchy \\nbecome prevalent in botany, we must expect to see \\nagain the old times, where each author gave to his \\nplant the name he fancied to be the best. \\nJohann Hedwig, Professor of Botany at Leipzig, \\nborn at Cronstaedt in Transylvania, Oct. 8, 1730, \\nstudied medicine at Presburg in Hungary, and died \\nFeb. 7, 1779, at the age of 69 years. He discovered, \\nby means of an extremely high magnifying micro- \\nscope, that those parts in mosses, which Linn^ took \\nfor female flowers, were male flowers, and that those \\nwhich were thought to be the male flowers were seed \\ncapsules only. His discoveries relate likewise to the \\niilices, algae, and fungi \\n* Johannis Hedwigil Fundamentum Historiae Naturalis mus- \\ncorum frondosorum. Pars I. II.

Country, at that Time; as the \\naes | a Pa tcue \\n\\niv PORE OR AS. \\nOak, Ath, Willow, @&c. are with \\n“us. Galen, like our Difpenfatory \\nWriters, and many others, have only \\ngiven their bare Names a Place \\namongft the reft of the Materia Me- \\ndica, without either Defcription or \\nVirtues; only adds their Temperature \\nand Faculties. Some have given the \\nNames, Temperatures, Virtues, Hif- \\ntory, and Figures; and mention the \\nAuthors that have treated on parti- \\ncular Herbs. Some have given their \\nDefcriptions and Names; but fay . \\nhittle of their Virtues; as Pena and \\nLobel. Some have defcribed the \\nPlants exaétly, but omit their Facul- \\nties; as Cefalpinus. Some have omit- \\nted their whole natural Hiffory, and \\nonly concifely and nervoufly given their \\nVirtues; as Schroder. Some give \\n‘the general Names of a few, and fome \\nof their Virtues; and pafs all the \\nrefi, to make Room for a Multitude \\nof Exotics; @s Quincy, and other \\n‘Commentators ou our prefent Difpen{a- \\n‘tories. . Some have given a moft exatt \\n\\noR EB ie oR. se \\nand noble Hiffory of their different \\nGenuffes and § Species ; but have been \\nvery {paring in their Virtues, and \\nwholly omitted the Uses of many; as \\nthe immortal Ray, the beft [yftematic \\n— Botanift that-ever wrote in England. \\nTo their Natural Hiftory fome have \\nadded a Chymical Analyfis, 07 which \\nthey have made their Virtues depend ; \\nas Dr. Herman, Lemery, and the \\nreat Tournefort. In Writing on \\nPlants, fome have given us counter feit \\nFigures, fays Johnfon, as Mathiolus \\non Diofcorides; and others counter feit \\nCures, as Amatus Lufitanus ; which, \\n\\\\Crato /ays, were Potius fidte quam \\nfate. Several have treated each only \\nof one Plant, -as Antonius Mufa ox \\nBetony ; Formius om | Maidenhair ; \\n‘Blotwitzch on” the Elder-Tree; Her- \\ntodt o Saffron ; Scharfius oz Juniper ; \\nChriftoph.

Feher 072 Wormwood, &*. \\neach of which forms a Kind of {mall \\n~Difpenfatory on bis favourite Herb. \\nSome, in Treating of the Virtues of \\nPlants, have feparated their Ufes; \\nputting the internal firft, and the ex- \\nzernal laft. Others have wire-drawn \\ntheir Difcourfes fiill further; not \\nonly in feparating their internal and \\nexternal Ufes; but, in different \\n Se&tions, given the various Forms in \\nwhich they are ufed, and Examples \\nof thofe Forms; and, laftly, their \\nhurtful Qualities; as Pemel of Cram- \\nbrook. But this prefent Work not \\nbeing intended for the Learned, and \\nGentlemen of the Faculty; but chiefly \\nfor the Benefit of the Poor, and their \\ngenerous Benefattors (tho, perhaps, \\nthe firft may find fome Things in it not \\nbelow their Notice) I have endea- \\nvoured fully, clearly, and concifely, \\nto collect the Virtues of the following \\nPlants from the moft eminent and ap- \\nproved Authors ; as Dodoneus, Tur- \\nner, Gerard, Parkinfon, Sim. Pauli, \\n| Schroder, \\n\\nPoke BP As OLR. vig. \\nSchroder, Ray, Tournefort, Herman, \\nClufius, Diofcorides, &c. which may \\nperhaps neither be an unacceptable nor \\nunprofitable Labour ; as itis, . \\n» fir, An Effay toward reviving - \\nand reftoring the Ufe of Simples; which \\nare now fo much neglefted, that many \\nof them are reckoned not only ufele/s, \\nbut troublefome; to get clear. of, or \\nkeep under which, the Poffeffors of \\nGrounds are. often put to a yearly Ex- \\npence and Labour. . 2. The LV eg let \\n— and Contempt of a great Part of our \\nown Plants has made Way for a Far- \\nrago of Exotics imported, and palmed \\non us; which; being neither of our \\nown Growth, Soil, nor Climate, may \\nprobably. not be. fo well fuited to our \\nConflitutions, .as thefe produced in the \\nSame. Soil..and Glinate with ourfelves. \\n3-.Lrom. the encouraged and increafed \\nConfumption of Exotics, and IVVegleét \\nof the. greatef.Part of our own Phy- \\nfical Aimples, we forget their Virtues \\nand Ufes: Hence they become Strangers \\n0 us, whilf we familiarize ourfelves \\nmeyan yD h) | eae e t \\n\\nvai Pi R EB.

As @ Confequence \\nof the laft, a Dif fe of our Simples \\nhas produced a great M. ultiplicity of \\nNoftrums, #4 Poff affors whereof fill \\nretain the Ufe of. our Plants as great \\nSecrets, and often with fuch aftonifbing \\nSuccefs as may put the regular and \\nfafrionable Praétifers\\' to the Blufh. \\n5. From this Negleé of our Simples, \\n‘al running into: Mixtures of aScant- \\nling of them with a Number of Exo- \\ntics ; or our Fondnefs for Compounds \\nor trufting too much tothe Produttion \\nof the Furnaces; we mmoft be at an \\n| Uncertainty what to charge their Ef- \\nfects upon; whether they are good or \\nbad: 6.

Andit — \\nlies too hard on many Parifbes, who \\nhave Abundance of Poor, but little or \\nno Trade, efpecially when fo few now \\nknow the commonVirtues of our own \\nHerbs. It is not only a Hardpip \\nupon the Poor, that fo few Simples are \\nufed in Prattice, but muft often dif- \\nappoint our Expeétation, fruftrate our \\nDefire, and the Hopes of the Sick; \\nJuch a {mall Handful of Simples not \\nbeing able to grapple with and van- \\nquifh Juch a Multitude of Difeafes \\nand their Symptoms; tho it muft be \\nconfeffed to be avery eafy Way for \\nTyros to come at the Knowledge of a \\nProfeffiion, when. a few Lines contain \\nall Neceffaries for its Praétice. And, \\nfince the prefent [mall Number of Ma- \\nterials may fuffce for Pra€tice, any \\nPerfon that can remember them may \\nturn Phyfician; and Phyficians may \\nbecome what they pleafe befides.

Lo \\ncon|utt Botanical Writers on the Vir- \\ntues of Plants, is aLash beyond the \\nReach of mofi private Perfons, . on \\nmany Accounts very obvious to the \\nReader. 8zthly, and lafily, T have not \\nonly endeavoured to give.a fair, im- \\npartial View, of . the Simples here \\ntreated of; . but, .as every Age, \\nand every Author, on this large Sub- \\ngett, have made fome further Difcoves \\n‘ries and Additions; fo I have thrown \\nin feveral from my own Obfervations, \\nthe Communications of Friends, and \\nfrom many practical Authors of the \\nbeft Repute: And, had I made. no \\nother Apology; it had. been enough to \\nJay, that.

Zo a the ern and avoid \\nthe \\n\\nBOR? & FAR GA ES © xiik \\nthe Danger, I have omitted molt of \\nthe poifonous Tribe; and, of the few \\ntaken in, only fo much of them as can \\nnot well be wanted,. and in that man- \\nner wherein they cannot readily do \\nHarm. 11. By negletting the Qua- \\nlities affigned them by the Ancients, \\nof hot, cold, dry,.or moift, in their \\nfeveral Degrees, and the various \\nMixtures of thofe Qualities: And \\nalfo the Whims of Aftrological Prattis \\n~ tioners, of the fundry Herbs being \\nunder the Dominion of [uch and {uch \\nPlanets, and when they were to be ga- \\nthered, prepared, and ufed, under \\ntheir refpettive, or oppofite Planets, \\nor their Conjunttions, or Oppofitions. \\n12.

I have. \\navoided lengthening the Difcour/e by: \\nan ufele/s and pompous Quotation of a \\n‘Crowd of Authors, or Extracting a. \\nMultizude of tedious Receipts. 15. \\nMoft of the cold Applications men- \\ntioned for the Gout, Eryfipelas, or \\narthritic Pains, &c. are left out, \\nknowing bow dangerous and fatal they \\nmay be: Yet it is a Prefumption, that \\nour Conftitutions are dwindled from \\nthofe of our Forefathers, who wfed \\nthat Courfe with Safety and Succe/s. \\n16. I have omitted a Rationale of the \\nfiffecis and Manner ‘of Operation of \\nSimples. L once defigned that the \\nRemedies which appear to me,-or I \\n_ had found moft Jucee/sful in Praétice, \\nfhould have been put in a di iif erent \\nLetter; but, as that had been Fore- \\nlee the Renibbh s Fudement, and \\nDifcouraging \\n\\nDee Ge ye Ge at | oe \\nDifcouraging bis further pel in \\nthe refl, I omitted it. \\nOf the few Plants fill retained in \\nour prefent Catalogues, a great Part \\nof their formerly experienced and com- \\nmonly, known .Virtues. are omitted ; \\nbecaufe it. is objetted, that our Aes \\nceftors afcribed far more Virtues.to \\nthem. than they.really had, ‘or deo \\nfend but then ee it be confidered, \\nThat various Conftitutions and Fa- \\nhis of Body do. neceffarily produce a \\nVariety and Difference of Effects in » \\nMedicines ou our Bodies, . as we fee \\nfrom daily Experience s the Bilious \\nrequire one Sort,..the Phlegmatic ano- \\nther, the Melanchalic a shins grofs, \\ncorpulent Bodies; and hettic, ninophir \\nFlabits, mpd be differently. treated, \\nand often in the fame Difeafe.... 2.

The fame Difeafes in fundry Ages \\nof Life challenge different Treatment : \\nWhat ts adapted to Infancy is too \\nweak for the Aged: Fox-glove, \\nGroundfel, Hellebore, Spurge, pro- \\nperly prepared, may be fafely given to \\nthe laft, but {ure none will adventure \\nthem on the Stomachs of the firft. \\n5. Lhings, that at one Time may be \\nmoft advifeable and beneficial, may at \\nanother Time be as hurtful and mif- \\nchievous in the fame Difeafe; as in \\nbyfteric Diforders, or where the Breaft \\nis fluff \\'d with much tough Phlegm: \\nIn the firft nervous and hyfteric Things \\nare beft; in the laf?

The \\nRoot prepared as above, or boil’d in fat Broth, and \\ngiven, is good in the Falling Sicknefs, Leprofy, \\nScab, Quartan Agues,: Dropfy, old Cough, Scia- \\ntica, Cramp, Pains of Joints, . and Sinews, Pain \\nand Swimming of the Head.  Parkinfon fays, it is \\nbeft prepared by Infufion in Juice of Quinces, | or \\nput in a hollow Quince, and either baked in the O- \\nven, or roafted under the Embers, and half a Scru- \\nple of it given at a Time: Thus Mathiolus uled it, \\nand, if its Ufe threatened Danger of Suffocation, Juice \\nand Syrup of Quince were the Antidote to it. Dio/- \\ncorides ufed it with other Things, to help Dimnefs \\nof Sight. ‘The Juice drop’d into the Ears cures \\ntheir Singing and Noife. Its Decoction, to wath \\nthe Head, kills Lice, and cures the running Scab, \\nor Sores on it, if mixt with Flower and a little Ho- \\nney and Butter. Its Decoction in Milk, fet where \\n- Fhes and Gnats fwarm, kills all that touch it; it \\nis fatal to Poultry that drink it. Made up in Balls \\nwith Honey and put into Mole-holes, it quickly. de- \\nftroys them, or other {mall Vermin. The pow- | \\ndered Root alone or with Marjoram fnuffed up the \\nNofe provokes violent Sneezing, and cleanfes the \\nHead. A Gargle of its Decoction, in Vinegar, -eafes \\nthe Toothach ; and Wafhing with it heals ee \\n2 Ha ee Scab \\n\\n({ H35e) . \\n\\' Scabon the Hands, and cleanfes Sores and Ulcers \\non the Legs, or other Parts. The Spaniards dip \\nand poifon their Arrows, wherewith they kul wild \\nBeafts, in the fermented Juice of this Root. It killg \\nall Animals inftantly, but, being drank, it hurts not. \\nIts only Antidote is Quince. ‘The Ancients prepar- \\ned the Root for Ufe, by either giving it with a triple \\nQuantity of Radifh, or the Radifh was prick’d full \\nof this Root, and left twenty-four Hours fticking in \\nit; then they took out, and threw away the Pric- \\n‘kles, and ufed the Radifh ; or they infufed the Ra- \\ndifh prick’d full of it in Oxymel, “and then ufed the \\nOxymel ; or they prick’d the Radifh full of it, and \\nlet it lie all Night ; next Day they pulled out and \\nthrew away the Prickles, and infufed the Radifh in \\nOxymel, and ufed the Liquor. It is certainly a \\nnoble Medicine in many of the above Difeafes, if \\nrightly prepared and ¢autioufly given.

The \\nfecond Water is only cooling, and» by the Solu- \\ntion of .the Acid of the untin’d Copper, it kills \\nWorms, but the Experiment is dangerous.. The \\nfir’ Water fhould neither be fined nor filtered to \\nclear it; for that robs it of its vegetable, aroma- \\ntic Oil, weakens it, nor will it keep long after ; \\nnor fhould it be kept in Bottles papered over the \\nMouth to keep out the Duft, but well corked with \\nthe beft Corks, for what comes over the Helm in \\ndiftilling, its lighter Parts will evaporate in the \\nAit, and weaken the Water. And becaufe fome \\nPeople, either ignorantly or wilfully, will diftill \\n fuch Plants as afford little, befide a little Fleem, \\nor Acid of the Herb, which cannot preferve the . \\nWater: from mothering, if they will have fuch \\nthey fhould have a little powdered Salt Petre to \\nkeep it, .Thus we may obferve, that ee \\nA \\nPeon | \\n~ \\n\\n(18) \\nOil, Salt and Spirit of Plants, are loft by Decoc- \\ntion; and that the Teaokhan of pungent, faline \\nAntifcorbutics.is ridiculous; and that odoriferous, \\nfapid and, aromatic Plants fhould) not be boiled. \\nThat by the Force of Fire, and too long Conti- \\nnuance of the Operation, . very oppofite Virtues \\nmay be raifed from Plants,.or a Water obtained \\nof very different Nature and. Effects, and. that \\ndifferent Ingredients require different Ways of Ma- \\nnagement, and various Degrees of Fire to obtain \\ntheir ufeful Properties. ‘This alfo intimates a \\nWay how to fubftitute diftilled Water, in Cafes \\nwhere no great Strefs is laid on, their Ufe, befides \\na Vehicle ; thus, drop.a few Drops of. the diftilled \\nOil of the Plant, asof Mint, Fennel, Pennyroyal, \\n(whofe Water is wanting) into. rectified Spirit of \\nWine, fo as the Oil be diffolved. wholly, and mix- \\ned with the Spirit, put two Drams of this Spirit \\ninto a Quart of Water, fhake:and mix them, and \\nyou have the Water wanted... Or if for imme- \\ndiate Ufe, drop fome Drops\\'-of the diftilled, Oil \\non a Piece of Sugar, or Sale, of “Bartar, rub it \\nwell in. a Mortar, and mix-with Water, this Wa- \\nter will not keep and. as the Virtue depends only \\non the Oil, one, two; three,.or four, Drops of \\nit, according to the Heat and Strength of the \\nOil, is much, better given ina Bolus. This alfo \\nteaches. us how to improve:the Strength of fimple \\ndiftilled Waters, viz. by adding,a Dram or two \\nof the above diffolved,; diftilled Oil, and rectified \\nSpirit, to each two or three Pounds of the Water. \\nBut this is done far more effectually by Cohobation, \\nwhich! may be made even to exceed: the Virtues of \\nthe Plants from which it is drawn, thus. — . \\nThe Diftillation being over, take out the Plant, \\nand, Water remaining in the Still, prefs. them \\nfroggy in a Strainer, till ea ips Liquor is expreft, \\nat pour \\n\\ncee \\npour the diftilled Water into it, put both back in- \\nto the Still, having firft put as much of the fame \\nPlant frefh got into the Still as before, afd if heed- \\nful, put in as much’ frefh Water as will make up \\nthe firft Quantity, clean the Wort as before, co- \\nver the Hole in the Still Head-pipe, Jute the Pipe \\nand Worm, clofe up the Veffel well, let all ftand \\nin a gentle Heat three Days and Nights, till the \\nfeparable Parts of the Plant are opened, loofened, \\nand difpofed to communicate its Virtues. to the \\nWater, then obferving more exactly the Rules in \\nthe former’ Procefs; diftill ic as before, only as \\nthis Liquor is richer and ftronger than the former, \\nit requires a lefs Degree of Heat and Fire, till half \\nthe Quantity of Water put on is obtained; then \\nftop the Procefs. This Water is whiter, thicker \\nand muddier than the former, has a ftronger \\nSmell and Tafte, as well as richer, is more du- \\nrable, and may havé its Virtues ftill exalted by \\nrepeating the Operation oftener with Herbs; and \\nif renewed a great many Times, the laft Liquor \\nmay be taken out of the Still, ftrain’d off, and in \\nan earthen, or well tin’d Veffel, fet on a flow Fire, \\nthat it neither burn, nor carry off its remaining \\nParts, and boiled up to an Extraét of the Con- \\nfittence of Honey or Moloffes, this: mix exactly \\nwith the Water obtained by feveral Diftillations, \\nthus ‘will the Virtues of the Plant be concinerated \\nfour ‘or five\\'Inches empty Space at Top, in cold \\nnet e456 ~* Ba “Winter \\n\\n( 20 ) \\nWinter Weather, pour on warm Water with a \\nfixth Part Honey diffolved in it, if a mild Seafon, \\none Eighth Part; but in Summer ufe the like \\nQuantity of coarfe, unrefined Sugar, or four \\nOunces of Barm, or light Yeaft, to every Gallon \\nof Water, fill up the Cafk to the fame Height \\nwith this Liquor, let it ftand upright, and cover \\nthe Bung-hole in the upper End, with a Piece of \\nloofe Board, let it ftand. warm, and continue in \\nthis State till the Herbs, which at firft rofe to the \\nTop, fubfide, and fall to the Bottom, which will \\nbe in four, five, or fix Days, then diftill directly \\nas before, obferving all the Rules there laid down. \\nThis Liquor being much ftronger and fpirituous \\nwill rife fooner, and with greater Force; therefore \\nmutt be diftilled more flowly, efpecially at firft, it \\nrequires lefs Heat and greater Caution. There \\ncomes over. firft a very ftrong, clear, penetrating \\nLiquor, which is beft for Ufe ; then a dark, mud- \\ndy, milky Liquor, poffefled of fome little Tafte \\nand. Smell of the Plant: Laftly, a thin, acid, \\n{carce odorous. Liquor ; all which muft be kept fe- \\nparate, what remains in the Still is chiefly the \\nSubftance of the Honey, Sugar or Yeaft, and lit- \\ntle of the Virtue of the Plant, to make an Extract \\nfrom. The firft Liquor, tho’ clear, yet mixt \\nwith Water turns Milk white, which fhews, that | \\nit, has brought. over. all the Oil of the Plant; and \\nthat the Whitenefs of diftilled, fimple Waters is \\nowing to that Oil, and when cleared by fining or \\nFiltration, the Water is effete and fpoiled. \\nThus we fee what Plants will afford us by fim- \\nple and cohobated Diftillations, viz. the proper \\nWater of the Herb, the Spirit contained in that \\nWater, and the volatile Oil of the Plant, which \\nturns its Water white, and a thin, feparable, vo- \\nlatile, acid Liquor; moft of thefe are loft.in their \\ne pee HE Se psd \\n\\nt \\n( 21 ) | \\nopen Decoétion. What remains behind all this, \\nnot to be obtained by Infufion, \\' Diftillation or De-. \\ncoction, is the conftitutive Oil of the Figure of the \\nPlant, which binds its earthy Parts together, and- \\ngives it its Form and Cement; a great deal of its \\nproper, native Salt, and that Part which by Fire is \\nchanged into a fixt Alcaline, and a great Part of \\nits conftitutive, elementary Earth, tho’ it has loft’ \\nfome in the Decoction, which may be found: both \\nin the Oil, and Liquor left in the Still. Could we \\nobtain all the fixt Oil by Diftillation or Deco¢tion, \\nthe Cementing, or cohefive Principle, would be \\nloft, and the Plant lofe its Figure and Form; and \\nhaving only Earth left, would fall down to Duft, \\nthe fixt Salt going with the Oil, thefe two being \\nthe foapy Part of the Plant. To obtain this fixt \\nSalt, take the Herbs ftrained out of the Liquor \\nafter Diftillation (for I here fuppofe the {trained \\nLiquor made into an Extract, if not fo ufed, take \\nboth Liquor and Herb out of the Still) put them \\ninto a clean iron Pan over a flow, clear Fire, \\nwhich raife by Degrees, there will firft arife a \\nFume, then the Plant turns black, then takes Fire \\nand burns, glows, fparkles and leaves a white \\nAth ; thus is confumed the fixt Oil of the Plant, \\nwhich gave its Parts Cohefion and Figure. Take \\nup thefe white Afhes, which are only the Earth \\nand fixt Salt of the Herb, put them in Water, let \\nall ftand till the Water is clear, then pour all into \\na filtering’ Cup, fo will the diffolved Salts and \\nWater go through, and leave the Earth in the \\nCup; evaporate the filtered Liquor in an earthen, \\' \\nor rather glafs Veffel, in a Sand Heat, or over a \\n\\' flow Fire, it leaves a white, alcaline, lixivial Salt, \\nwhich was in the Plant, but now altered by the - \\nFire, mix this Salt with the diftilled Water; fo \\nhave you all the Parts of the Plant-except ‘the fixt - \\n7B 9 Oil \\n— \\n\\n( 22) \\nOil. and Earth, which can only be got by. ufing the \\nPlant.in ‘Subftance j in Powder, Pills, or Electuary. \\nThe Liquor and Herbs left in the Still from Diftil- \\nlation,. by Fermentation with Honey or..Sugar, \\nafford not this Salt, for Honey burns to a Coal. \\nThe cold Still is only fit for tender Flowers, which \\nyet are better diftilled by the Alembic, with proper \\nCare. Exglifp Plants fit for Ditillation are, An- \\ngelica, Baum, Spiermint, Pepper-mint, Calamint, \\nHyfiop, Pennyroyal, Rue, whofe Water is good \\nfor little without feveral Cohgbations; which is ad- \\nmirable in, hyfteric Convulfions ; Camomile, _Cala- \\nmus, aromaticus,.

Which might be \\ngiven in Waters of other Herbs, of the fame In- \\ntentions. But remember that mucilaginous Plants \\nare not eafily reducible to this. Form, for they will \\nburn before they come to.a due Confiftence, with- \\nout very great Care and. Judgment, as Roots of \\nComfrey, “Althea, Serra, Fern, Ofmond Royal, \\nLinfeed, Flea-bane, €c. Red and damask Rofes \\nare both diftilled, but very idly, for the latter af- \\nfords | much the beft Water, yet neither much \\nworth, \\n\\n| ( 23) \\nwotth, only a little light, feparable Oil of the \\nFlower is brought over, that gives it a Smell, \\nwhich makes it, little cordial and reviving, but \\nwithout any Regard to Diftillation, a good aftrin- \\ngent Extract’ may be got from the former, and a \\nlovely, laxative Syrup from the latter, better than \\nthat of Rhubarb, for no Purgatives are worth \\ndiftilling, that Part of the Plant being too grofs or \\nponderous to come over the Helm. The Dofe of \\ndiftilled Waters is from half an Ounce, to two, \\nthree, or four Ounces, according to the Age of \\nthe Patient, and Nature of the Water, the Dofe \\nof Extract is from ten Grains to a Dram. Thus \\nmuch for Infufions; Decoétions, Diftillations, Ex- \\ntracts and Incineration, as they relate. only to do- \\nmeftic, not officinal Remedies. — . | \\nSyrups are another Form, they are in a great \\nMeafure defervedly neglected in the prefent Prac- \\ntice; except Anodynes,’ Laxatives and Purgations ; \\nfor alexipharmac, ‘diaphoretic, cordial, antifcorbu- \\ntic, cephalic, nervous, &c, Syrups are a meer Jeft \\nand Fraud, that Form being fo loaded with Sugar, \\nthat they feldom reach farther than the firft Paf- \\nfages. One great Ufe of them was to render feve- . \\nral Forms of Remedies more palatable, which is \\nnow moftly anfwered by ufing Sugar, or white \\nSyrup, (which is only made of Sugar and Water) \\nin their Room. No Plants proper for Diftillation, or \\nconfifting ‘of volatile: Principles, can be ufed in \\nthis Form without the Lofs of thefe Parts ; there- \\nfore thofe only fit for Decottion are proper for it 5 \\nthefe are the beft which are of a faline and earthy \\nNature. Dried Herbs (if they will bear drying) \\nare much the beft, for only the Flegm, or Water \\nof the Green, being dried away, they will commu- \\nnicate more of ‘their faline and fubftantial Parts to \\n* the’Water, fo that the Syrup will be both ftronger \\n° BS | *B 4 . of \\n\\n( 24°) \\nof the Ingredients, finer, and keep longer. But \\nthe beft of them, if not boiled up to a due Con- © \\nfiftence, will turn acid and four, mouldy or fpoil, \\nefpecially if made of green Herbs, fo that faving \\nSugar, Coal and Time, is bad Husbandry here ; \\nbut Syrups made of the Juice of Herbs is far \\nworfe, for in drying «nothing is loft but the » \\nFlegm, but in the Juice fome of the Parts are not \\ndifpofed to feparate fo -eafily from the conftituting \\nearthy Part of the Plant, and of thofe that depart \\nfrom it ; feveral are loft in the neceffary Purifica- \\ntion, and Clarifications of the Juice, and ftill the \\nSyrup is more unfightly, and-not fo pleafant. \\nThe feveral Ways of clarifying Infufions, Decoc- \\ntions, or Juices, are, either to let them ftand fome \\nHours in a cool Place, in a clean Vefiel, well co- \\nvered, till they let fall their gravily, earthy, or \\nother grofs or heavy Parts, then pour off the clear, \\nor pafs them feveral Times through a Hyppocras \\nBag or Strainer, till they become clear, but tho” \\nthey are hereby made finer, yet fome of their \\ngummy, refinous or vifcous Parts may be loft, \\nwhich is the Reafon that purging, mucilaginous, \\nand anodyne Syrups fhould never be clarified. Or \\nmix frefh Whites of Eges with the Deco¢tion, and \\nwhifk them long together, then boil all, and as \\nthe Whites of Eges harden in boiling, they in- \\ntangle the grofler Parts. with them, fo that the \\nftrain’d Liquor put through a Hyppocras Bag is \\nclear. . Syrups fhould be prepared either in earthen \\nor well-tin’d copper Vefiels.———— Some ufeful Fa- \\nmily Syrups are made without any Heat, and lit- \\ntle Trouble or Expence, as thefe of Snails, or \\nEarth Worms, which are gathered in a dewy \\nMorning, the former are taken out of the Shells, \\nand flit; the latter are wafh’d and cut, toa Pound \\nof either of them, put half a Pound of fine oft \\ner’¢ \\n\\n( 25 ) \\nder’d Sugar, mix them well, and hang all up in a \\nBag in a cool, moift Cellar, and let the Syrup \\ndrop from the Bag into an earthen Veffel under \\nthem ; they are good for weak, hegtical Children, \\nDole from half a one to two Spoonfuls, —— \\nSyrups of fragrant, Flowers of thin, loofe, volatile \\nParts, as Rofes, Violets, Clove-gilly Flowers, \\nCowflips, Peach Flowers, &?c. are made by pour- \\ning as much boiling Water on them as will f{cald \\nthem well, Jet them ftand ten or twelve Hours, \\nor all Night, in a clofe, well-cover’d, glaz’d, or \\nwell-tin’d Veffel (tho’ all Metals are in Danger to \\n{poil their Colour and Beauty) ftrain them off, and \\nto every Pint of the Liquor add a Pound and a \\nhalf of Loaf Sugar (which is enough for Family \\nUfe, if made yearly, and too much Sugar {poils \\nthe Defign of the Medicines, (if it meant .any \\nthing.) Set all on the fame Vefiel, cleared ona \\nSand, or other gentle Heat, till either the Sugar \\nbe well diffolved and mixt, or they come to the \\nConfiftence of a Syrup, Dofe of the Syrup of Vio- \\nlets, pale Rofe, and Peach Flowers, from half an \\nOunce to two Ounces, but the Second is the beft ; \\nthe firft is little worth, except to give Mixtures a \\nfine Colour or Flavour, or with Oil of {weet Al- \\nmonds, or Linfeed, to give Children for a Cold; \\nthe third being found too churlifh and eriping a \\nPurge for Children, is moftly laid afide, and in \\nmaking it requires four or five Infufions of the \\nfame ftrained Liquor on frefh Flowers. The Dofe \\nof the reft of thofe Syrups is what you pleafe, for \\nthey will neither do good, nor harm. Syrup of - \\nCorn Poppies is made by a double Infufion of four \\nPints of Water, on two Pound of the Flowers ; \\nor rather by pouring juft fo much as will {cald \\nthem; a Pound and a half of Loaf-Sugar to each \\nPint of Water may fuffice, and made as aerate \\nor \\n\\n( 26 ) \\nfor boiling {poils it; Dofe from one Quarter of ‘an \\nOunce, to two Ounces, in Poppy!

But it would be better \\nHusbandry to take two or three Ounces of what \\nremains in the Still after the Spirit is drawn off ; to \\ntwo Ounces of this, put eighteen Ounces of Ca- \\nnary, mix them well, and filter the Liquor, and \\nwith double Quantity of Sugar make a Syrup, \\nDofe as above. A good pectoral Syrup may \\nbe made by infufing two Ounces of Liver of Sul- \\nphur, three Days in a Pint of Canary, then filter \\nit, and add a Pound, or a Pound and a half of \\nSugar, melt it without boiling, Dofe from one \\nQuarter to one Ounce. Several Syrups are \\nmade of the Juices of Fruits, as of Rafberries, \\nQuinces, Berberries, Mulberries, Elder, Buck- | \\nthorn, &c. They are made by putting a Pound \\nand a half of Sugar, to a Pound of Juice, and \\nboiling them up to a Syrup, Dofe of all thefe what \\nyou will, except the laft, which is from half an \\nOunce to an Ounce or two,’ but it is too harfh for \\nmoft Children, this Juice is neither to be clarified ~ \\nflor made with Loaf, but coarfe Sugar.— \\nMany Syrups are made by Decoétion,. or boiling \\n_ the Ingredients, but moft of them are good for \\n- néught; but fuch as are in Love with the Form \\nmay take the Roots, dried Herbs, Flowers, or \\nSeeds they intend, cut or‘bruife them, pour boil- \\ning Water on them, to the Height of three or four \\nFingers above the Ingredients, cover them up, \\nand let them ftand a Night or two; then ie \\n; , tin” \\n\\n(27°) \\ntin’d Vefiel boil away the Water to tworThirds, \\nor a half, {train out the Liquor, and to‘each Pint \\nof it, a Pound, or a Pound and a) halfiof Sugar, \\n. is enough for Family Ufe,: boil all. up to:a‘Syrup, \\nand if it is neither for vomiting, nor purging, nor \\nfor fleeping, Dofe what you pleafe under a Pint, \\nit only cloys the Stomach and/Bowels, except: in \\nCoughs and Colds, the Sugar may make them of \\nfome little Ufe, as Peétorals.
