      "Abstract: ['Plumbagin is one of the simplest plant secondary metabolite of three major phylogenic families viz. Plumbaginaceae, Droseraceae, and Ebenceae, and exhibits highly potent biological activities, including antioxidant, antiinflammatory, anticancer, antibacterial, and antifungal activities. Recent investigations indicate that these activities arise mainly out of its ability to undergo redox cycling, generating reactive oxygen species and chelating trace metals in biological system. The compound is endowed with a property to inhibit the drug efflux mechanism in drug-resistant bacteria, thereby allowing intracellular accumulation of the potent drug molecules. An interesting bioactivity exhibited by this compound is the elimination of stringent, conjugative, multidrug-resistant plasmids from several bacterial strains including opportunistic bacteria, such as Acinetobacter baumannii. Moreover, plumbagin effectively induces apoptosis and causes cell cycle arrest, which is, in part, due to the inactivation of NF-κB in cancer cells. Therefore, it has been suggested that designing \"hybrid drug molecules\" of plumbagin by combining it with other appropriate anticancer agents may lead to the generation of novel and potent anticancer drugs with pleiotropic action against human cancers. This comprehensive review is an attempt to understand the chemistry of plumbagin and catalog its biological activities reported to date.']\n",

      "Abstract: ['Secondary metabolites provide a potential source for the generation of host plant resistance and development of biopesticides. This is especially important in view of the rapid and vast spread of agricultural and horticultural pests worldwide. Multiple pests control tactics in the framework of an integrated pest management (IPM) programme are necessary. One important strategy of IPM is the use of chemical host plant resistance. Up to now the study of chemical host plant resistance has, for technical reasons, been restricted to the identification of single compounds applying specific chemical analyses adapted to the compound in question. In biological processes however, usually more than one compound is involved. Metabolomics allows the simultaneous detection of a wide range of compounds, providing an immediate image of the metabolome of a plant. One of the most universally used metabolomic approaches comprises nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). It has been NMR which has been applied as a proof of principle to show that metabolomics can constitute a major advancement in the study of host plant resistance. Here we give an overview on the application of NMR to identify candidate compounds for host plant resistance. We focus on host plant resistance to western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) which has been used as a model for different plant species.']\n",

The deduced amino acid sequences showed 51%-73% identity to other CHS/STS type sequences of the PKS family. Further, phylogenetic analysis revealed that these PKS cDNAs grouped with other non-chalcone-producing PKSs. Homology modeling analysis of these cannabis PKSs predicts a 3D overall fold, similar to alfalfa CHS2, with small steric differences on the residues that shape the active site of the cannabis PKSs.\"]\n",

Nevertheless, there is little information regarding the influence of S fertilization on sprouts and seedlings. An experiment was set up to evaluate the effect of S fertilization, supplied as K(2)SO(4) at 0, 15, 30, and 60 mg/L, on the glucosinolate content of broccoli sprouts during the germination course of 3, 6, 9, and 12 d after sowing. Glucosinolate concentration was strongly influenced by germination, causing a rapid increase during the first 3 d after sowing, and decreasing afterwards. The S supply increased aliphatic and total glucosinolate content at the end of the monitored sprouting period. S-treated sprouts, with S(15), S(30), and S(60) at 9 and 12 d after sowing presented enhanced glucosinolate content. Overall, both germination time and S fertilization were key factors in maximizing the bioactive health-promoting phytochemicals of broccoli. Practical Application: Germination with sulphate is a simple and inexpensive way to obtain sprouts that contain much higher levels of glucosinolates (health promoting compounds), than the corresponding florets from the same seeds.']\n",

      "Abstract: ['The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana contains a large arsenal of secondary metabolites that are not essential in development but have important ecological functions in counteracting attacks of pathogens and herbivores. Preformed secondary compounds are often referred to as phytoanticipins and metabolites, that are synthesized de novo in response to biotic stress are known as phytoalexins. Camalexin is the typical phytoalexin of Arabidopsis. It has antimicrobial activity towards some pathogens and was shown to be an important component of disease resistance in several plant pathogen interactions. Glucosinolates (GS) are characteristic phytoanticipins of the Brassicaceae family including Arabidopsis. GS are best known as repellents or attractants for herbivorous insects and their predators whereas their antimicrobial potential has received relatively little attention. The GS are glucosides and the biologically active aglycone is released upon biotic stress by glucohydrolase enzymes commenly called myrosinases. Because an Arabidopsis mutant susceptible to the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora brassicae shows a partial deficiency in both camalexin and iGS accumulation we became intrigued by the role of these secondary compounds in disease resistance. Our results show that disease resistance of Arabidopsis to P. brassicae is established by the combined action of iGS and camalexin.']\n",

Gymnema sylvestre is a rich source of gymnemic acids (saponins) that find application in the treatment of diabetes. The present study is an attempt to evaluate the effect of various metal salts (cadmium chloride, mercuric chloride, silver nitrate, cupric chloride, cobaltous chloride and calcium chloride) in eliciting the response from G. sylvestre suspension cultures. The maximum gymnemic acid production in the suspensions was achieved on day 12 of culture, though the maximum biomass was obtained on day 16. Among the different salts, CdCl(2) gave maximum response (59.97\\xa0mg/gDCW) at 2\\xa0mM concentration after a 24\\xa0h time period, while, AgNO(3) gave the least response (18.35\\xa0mg/gDCW) on incubation of 48\\xa0h at 1\\xa0mM concentration, in terms of gymnemic acid accumulation.

The enhanced gymnemic acid production shown by the suspensions in response to the metal salts indicates their role in evoking the plant defense mechanisms. These elicitation studies help in providing a platform for improved commercial supply of bioactive gymnemic acids.']\n",

      "Abstract: ['Predictions of grapevine yield and the management of sugar accumulation and secondary metabolite production during berry ripening may be improved by monitoring nitrogen and starch reserves in the perennial parts of the vine. The standard method for determining nitrogen concentration in plant tissue is by combustion analysis, while enzymatic hydrolysis followed by glucose quantification is commonly used for starch. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FT-IR) combined with chemometric modelling offers a rapid means for the determination of a range of analytes in powdered or ground samples. ATR-FT-IR offers significant advantages over combustion or enzymatic analysis of samples due to the simplicity of instrument operation, reproducibility and speed of data collection. In the present investigation, 1880 root and wood samples were collected from Shiraz, Semillon and Riesling vineyards in Australia and Germany. Nitrogen and starch concentrations were determined using standard analytical methods, and ATR-FT-IR spectra collected for each sample using a Bruker Alpha instrument. Samples were randomly assigned to either calibration or test data sets representing two thirds and one third of the samples respectively. Signal preprocessing included extended multiplicative scatter correction for water and carbon dioxide vapour, standard normal variate scaling with second derivative and variable selection prior to regression. Excellent predictive models for percent dry weight (DW) of nitrogen (range: 0.10-2.65% DW, median: 0.45% DW) and starch (range: 0.25-42.82% DW, median: 7.77% DW) using partial least squares (PLS) or support vector machine (SVM) analysis for linear and nonlinear regression respectively, were constructed and cross validated with low root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEP). Calibrations employing SVM-regression provided the optimum predictive models for nitrogen (R(2)=0.98 and RMSEP=0.07% DW) compared to PLS regression (R(2)=0.97 and RMSEP=0.08% DW). The best predictive models for starch was obtained using PLS regression (R(2)=0.95 and RSMEP=1.43% DW) compared to SVR (R(2)=0.95; RMSEP=1.56% DW). The RMSEP for both nitrogen and starch is below the reported seasonal flux for these analytes in Vitis vinifera. Nitrogen and starch concentrations in grapevine tissues can thus be accurately determined using ATR-FT-IR, providing a rapid method for monitoring vine reserve status under commercial grape production.']\n",

During the period of full flowering, selected phenological (number of days to flowering), morphological (plant height, mean leaf area, number of black glands/leaf) and chemical (hypericin and pseudohypericin content) characteristics were assessed. Our observations were that the \"Veperikon\" cultivar is very sensitive to soil-borne diseases. All transplanted seedlings were infected by the plant pathogenic fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, which caused necrosis of the whole plant.

The current study discusses the scope of synthetic biology for human therapeutics via microbial approach. In this context, synthetic biology aims at designing, engineering and building new microbial synthetic cells that do not pre-exist in nature as well as re-engineer existing microbes for synthesis of therapeutic products. It is expected that the construction of novel microbial genetic circuitry for human therapeutics will greatly benefit from the data generated by 'omics' approaches and multidisciplinary nature of synthetic biology. Development of novel antimicrobial drugs and vaccines by engineering microbial systems are a promising area of research in the field of synthetic biology for human theragnostics.

Plant defense against pathogenic microorganisms depends on an innate immunity system that is activated as a result of infection. There are two mechanisms of triggering this system: basal immunity activated as a result of a perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns through pattern recognition receptors situated on the cell surface and effector-triggered immunity (ETI). An induced biosynthesis of bioactive secondary metabolites, in particular phytoalexins, is one of the mechanisms of plant defense to fungal infection. Results of the study on narrow leaf lupin (<i>Lupinus angustifolius</i> L.) plants infected with the anthracnose fungus <i>Colletotrichum lupini</i> and treated with fungal phytotoxic metabolites are described in the paper. The <i>C. lupini</i> phytotoxins were isolated from liquid cultures, purified and partially characterized with physicochemical methods. Accumulation of secondary metabolites on leaf surface and within the tissues of plants either infected, treated with the fungal phytotoxin or submitted to both treatments was studied using GC-MS and LC-MS, respectively.

Two major techniques for metabolomics in the last 10\\xa0years are gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Each platform has a specific performance detecting subsets of metabolites. GC-MS in combination with derivatisation has a preference for small polar metabolites covering primary metabolism. In contrast, reversed phase LC-MS covers large hydrophobic metabolites predominant in secondary metabolism. Here, we present an integrative metabolomics platform providing a mean to reveal the interaction of primary and secondary metabolism in plants and other organisms. The strategy combines GC-MS and LC-MS analysis of the same sample, a novel alignment tool MetMAX and a statistical toolbox COVAIN for data integration and linkage of Granger Causality with metabolic modelling. For metabolic modelling we have implemented the combined GC-LC-MS metabolomics data covariance matrix and a stoichiometric matrix of the underlying biochemical reaction network. The changes in biochemical regulation are expressed as differential Jacobian matrices. Applying the Granger causality, a subset of secondary metabolites was detected with significant correlations to primary metabolites such as sugars and amino acids. These metabolic subsets were compiled into a stoichiometric matrix N. Using N the inverse calculation of a differential Jacobian J from metabolomics data was possible.

The test agents were orally administered once daily for 11 consecutive days, and treatment effects on body weight changes, basal rectal temperature, and foot-shock-triggered hyperthermic responses were quantified on Day 1, Day 5, Day 7, and Day 10 of the experiments. Pentobarbital-induced hypnosis was quantified on the 11(th) day of treatment. Observations made during a pilot dose finding experiment revealed that, like A.\\xa0paniculata extracts, pure andrographolide also possess adaptogenic properties. Observed dose-dependent efficacies of 3\\xa0mg/kg/d, 10\\xa0mg/kg/d, and 30\\xa0mg/kg/d andrographolide in the pilot experiment were reconfirmed by conducting two further analogous experiments using separate groups of either male or female mice. In these confirmatory experiments, efficacies of andrographolide were compared with that of 5\\xa0mg/kg/d oral doses of the standard anxiolytic diazepam. Significantly reduced body weights and elevated core temperatures of the three vehicle-treated control groups observed on the 5(th) day and subsequent observational days were completely absent even in the groups treated with the lowest andrographolide dose (3\\xa0mg/kg/d) or diazepam (5\\xa0mg/kg/d). Benzodiazepine-like potentiation of pentobarbital hypnosis was observed in andrographolide-treated animals. These observations reveal that andrographolide is functionally a diazepam-like desensitizer of biological mechanisms, and processes involved in stress trigger thermoregulatory and other physiological responses.']\n",

The aim of this study is isolation of secondary metabolite from Penicillium, an endophytic of A. squamosa L. Penicillium sp. from endophytic of A. squamosa L. was fermented in Wicherham media. The whole extract from both liquid media and mycelium was partitioned by ethyl acetate and evaporated to obtain crude ethyl acetate extract. The ethyl acetate extract was then brokedown using column chromatography with silica as stationary phase and mixture of ethyl acetate/methanol (98%:2%) as mobile phase and then was separated by sephadex column. Structure elucidation of isolated compounds were mainly done by analysis of one and two dimensional NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) data and supported by HPLC (High performance Liquid Chromatography) and MS-TOF (Mass Spectrometer-Time of Flight). Isolated secondary metabolites were tested using in vitro assays for anticancer and antimicrobial activity. For anticancer activity, the metabolites were tested against breast cancer cells (MCF-7) using MTT assay, while for antimicrobial activity was performed using disk diffusion assays. From these physical, chemical and spectral evidences that the secondary metabolites were confirmed as Chrysogine and Meleagrine.

A549 cells did not polarize under the same conditions. Altered organization of actin filaments in both cell types were noticed suggesting that extracts from <i>L. album</i> L. change TER and actin filaments, and somehow may block cell mechanisms, leading to the polarization of MDCK II cells.']\n",

Neurotoxicity involves the response of glial cells, mainly astrocytes, which play a fundamental role in the control of homeostasis of the CNS. Some Erythroxylum species are indigenous to the state of Bahia in Brazil. This study investigated the cytotoxic activity of the diterpene AEP-1, extracted from the fruit of E. passerinum in a GL-15 cell line, astrocytic, glial cells model. The effects on cell viability, analyzed by the MTT assay, demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, with maximum effect at 500 μg/mL of AEP-1, and with a reduction of about 40 and 47% on cellular viability after 24 h and 72 h treatment, respectively. Evidence for induction of apoptosis by AEP-1 was first obtained when GL-15 glial cells were incubated with 250 μg/mL AEP-1 causing reniform and/or pyknotic nuclei and apoptotic bodies revealed by chromatin staining with Hoechst 33258. Increase in DNA fragmentation was also observed by comet assays in cells incubated with 500 μg/mL of AEP-1. Moreover, cells exposed to a sub toxic dose of AEP-1 (250 μg/mL) showed significant changes in morphology--contraction of the cytoplasm and expansion of cellular projections--signifying the presence of astrocytic cytoskeletal protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These findings indicated astrocytic cells as the target for terpene AEP-1 and suggest the involvement of glial cells with psychoactive symptoms observed in humans and animals after consumption of fruits of plants of the genus Erythroxylum.']\n",

Unfortunately, very few of them have been scientifically evaluated to know about the deep inside. The current study here is designed to evaluate the in vivo sedative activity of the leaves of Glochidion multiloculare (Rottler ex Willd) Voigt. With this purpose, the plant leaves were collected and powdered for extraction with methanol. Initially, the plant extract was subjected to brine shrimp lethality bioassay to monitor the presence of bioactive molecules. Later on, different neuropharmacological studies including hole cross, open field, thiopental-sodium induced sleeping time and Elevated-Plus Maze (EPM) tests were conducted to investigate sedative action. In the brine shrimp lethality bioassay, the LC50 value of the extract was found 37.19 μg mL(-1), whereas the standard vincristine sulphate showed the LC50 10.50 μg mL(-1). The moderate toxicity of the extract on brine shrimp indicated the existence of bioactive secondary metabolites in this extract. Besides, the extract decreased the locomotor activity of mice in hole cross, open field and EPM test indicating the CNS depression capability of the plant. Moreover, the extract was very much effective for prolonging the sleeping time (103 min) with quick onset of action (22 min) in comparison to the control group. The efficacy of the plant extract was found closer to the common sedative drug diazepam. Further investigations are required to explore the underlying mechanism of the sedative action and isolate bioactive principles.']\n",

This species is recognised as a cellulolytic and/or endophytic fungus. It is also known as a source of secondary metabolites with various biological activities, having great potential in the agricultural, medicinal and industrial fields. On the negative side, C. globosum has been reported as an air contaminant causing adverse health effects and as causal agent of human fungal infections. However, the taxonomic status of C. globosum is still poorly understood. The contemporary species concept for this fungus includes a broadly defined morphological diversity as well as a large number of synonymies with limited phylogenetic evidence. The aim of this study is, therefore, to resolve the phylogenetic limits of C. globosum s.str. and related species. Screening of isolates in the collections of the CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre (The Netherlands) and the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Centre (China) resulted in recognising 80 representative isolates of the C. globosum species complex. Thirty-six species are identified based on phylogenetic inference of six loci, supported by typical morphological characters, mainly ascospore shape. Of these, 12 species are newly described here. Additionally, C. cruentum, C. mollipilium, C. rectum, C. subterraneum and two varieties of C. globosum are synonymised under C. globosum s.str., and six species are resurrected, i.e. C. angustispirale, C. coarctatum, C. cochliodes, C. olivaceum, C. spiculipilium and C. subglobosum. Chaetomium ascotrichoides is segregated from C. madrasense and the genus name Chaetomidium is rejected. Five species, including C. globosum s.str., are typified here to stabilise their taxonomic status. A further evaluation of the six loci used in this study as potential barcodes indicated that the 28S large subunit (LSU) nrDNA and the internal transcribed spacer regions and intervening 5.8S nrRNA (ITS) gene regions were unreliable to resolve species, whereas β-tubulin (tub2) and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (rpb2) showed the greatest promise as DNA barcodes for differentiating Chaetomium species. This study provides a starting point to establish a more robust classification system for Chaetomium and for the Chaetomiaceae.']\n",

      "Abstract: [\"Currently there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD); clinical trials are underway to reduce amyloid generation and deposition, a neuropathological hallmark in brains of AD patients. While genetic factors and neuroinflammation contribute significantly to AD pathogenesis, whether increased cholesterol level is a causative factor or a result of AD is equivocal. Prenylation of proteins regulating neuronal functions requires mevalonate-derived farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). The observation that the levels of FPP and GGPP, but not that of cholesterol, are elevated in AD patients is consistent with the finding that statins, competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, reduce FPP and GGPP levels and amyloid β protein production in preclinical studies. Retrospective studies show inverse correlations between incidence of AD and the intake and serum levels of the HMG CoA reductase-suppressive tocotrienols; tocopherols show mixed results. Tocotrienols, but not tocopherols, block the processing and nuclear localization of sterol regulatory element binding protein-2, the transcriptional factor for HMG CoA reductase and FPP synthase, and enhance the degradation of HMG CoA reductase. Consequently, tocotrienols deplete the pool of FPP and GGPP and potentially blunt prenylation-dependent AD pathogenesis. The antiinflammatory activity of tocotrienols further contributes to their protection against AD. The mevalonate- and inflammation-suppressive activities of tocotrienols may represent those of an estimated 23,000 mevalonate-derived plant secondary metabolites called isoprenoids, many of which are neuroprotective. Tocotrienol-containing plant foods and tocotrienol derivatives and formulations with enhanced bioavailability may offer a novel approach in AD prevention and treatment.\"]\n",

Despite its significant economic importance, no data regarding the primary and secondary metabolites of the aforementioned cultivars exist. Thus, in the current study, the effect of sun drying process on the qualitative attributes and phenolic profile of 'Mavro' and 'Xynisteri' musts was dissected. Musts were analyzed at harvest and at the end of the sun-drying process that corresponds to ca. 30-40% water loss. Results highlighted significant differences in chemical composition of the must before and after the sun-drying process. Except for the increase of soluble solids content, a significant increment in glucose, fructose, total acidity, total phenols and total flavonoids contents was monitored. Subsequently, forty-two phenolic compounds were identified by LC-DAD-qTOF-MS revealing the polyphenolic fingerprint of the two cultivars. Results also indicated that changes in the phenolic composition of the obtained must are not only correlated with the dehydration effect, but both synthesis or degradation reactions occurred. In particular, the increases in the concentration of hydroxybenzoic acids were higher than the concentration effect for both cultivars. Regarding to hydroxycinnamates, dehydration caused a six-fold increase of hydroxycinnamic acid content in both cultivars. Intriguingly, the concentration of some hydroxycinnamic acids such as caffeic acid dihexoside and fertaric acid isomer went descending. Although the degradation of the internal side of the skin facilitate improved extractability from the skins to the grape pulp and therefore to the grape must, the sun-drying process may also induced stilbene and lignans synthesis production. A significant effect of dehydration on the postharvest biosynthesis of three groups of flavonoids (flavonols, flavan-3-ols, flavanonols), was also observed. This study sheds some light in the substantial changes that occur in specific metabolites during the sun drying process; such metabolites can be considered as potential factors that may determine organoleptic characteristics and biological properties of the end-product.\"]\n",

Nowadays, the most consumed beverages are obtained from Camellia sinensis leaves and coffee grain processing, and contain different classes of polyphenols and phenolic acids in their phytochemical composition. Besides C. sinensis and coffee, numerous plants have been receiving attention due to their phytochemical composition and pharmacological effects, such as yerba mate, hibiscus, chamomile, lemongrass, fennel and mentha. Furthermore, atomized or lyophilized medicinal plant extracts can be employed in many beverage formulations and the consumption of these products is an excellent delivery means for nutrients and bioactive compounds, such as: minerals, vitamins, terpenes, antioxidants, saponins, alkaloids and polysaccharides. Innovation in food processing in order to insert functional and medicinal beverages in the human diet poses a challenge for the coming years. The technological development of new processing forms and use of plants with bioactive metabolites could be an important tool in relation to this proposal. In this context, this review has aimed to summarize and analyze pharmacological, phytochemistry and technological aspects of species with classical ethnobotanical and traditional use.']\n",

Wurtzite phase ZnONPs with a band gap energy of 3.28 eV were produced by exploiting a simple and green biosynthesis method using an inexpensive precursor of <i>A. indica</i> leaf extract and zinc nitrate. ZnONPs were characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, XRD, FTIR, SEM, EDX, DLS, TEM, and zeta-potential analysis. The primary size obtained was 26.3 nm (XRD) and 33.5 ± 6.5 nm (TEM), whereas, the secondary size was found to be 287 ± 5.2 nm with -32.8 ± 1.8 mV ζ-potential denoting the physical colloid chemistry of ZnONPs. Crystallinity and the spherical morphology of ZnONPs were also evident with some sort of particle agglomeration. ZnONPs retained plant functional groups endorsing their hydrophilic character. The antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of ZnONPs was significant (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05) and the MIC/MBC against most frequent clinical isolates of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 (MIC)/1.0 to 1.5 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> (MBC). The dissolution of ZnONPs to Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions in a nutrient medium increased as a result of interaction with the bacterial surface and metabolites. Substantial surface binding of ZnONPs followed by intracellular uptake disrupted the cell morphology and caused obvious injury to the cell membrane. Interrupted bacterial growth kinetics, loss of cell respiration, enhanced production of intracellular ROS, and the leakage of the cytoplasmic content unequivocally suggested a strong interaction of ZnONPs with the exterior cell surface and intracellular components, eventually leading to cell death and destruction of biofilms. Overall, the results elucidated eco-friendly production of ZnONPs expressing a prominent interfacial correlation with bacteria and hence, prospecting the use of green ZnONPs as effective nanoantibiotics.']\n",

      "Abstract: ['The upsurge of multiple drug resistance (MDR) bacteria substantially diminishes the effectiveness of antibiotic arsenal and therefore intensifies the rate of therapeutic failure. The major factor in MDR is efflux pump-mediated resistance. A unique pump can make bacteria withstand a wide range of structurally diverse compounds. Therefore, their inhibition is a promising route to eliminate resistance phenomenon in bacteria. Phytochemicals are excellent alternatives as resistance-modifying agents. They can directly kill bacteria or interact with the crucial events of pathogenicity, thereby decreasing the ability of bacteria to develop resistance. Numerous botanicals display noteworthy efflux pumps inhibitory activities. Edible plants are of growing interest. Likewise, some plant families would be excellent sources of efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) including Apocynaceae, Berberidaceae, Convolvulaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, and Zingiberaceae. Easily applicable methods for screening plant-derived EPIs include checkerboard synergy test, berberine uptake assay and ethidium bromide test. In silico high-throughput virtual detection can be evaluated as a criterion of excluding compounds with efflux substrate-like characteristics, thereby improving the selection process and extending the identification of EPIs. To ascertain the efflux activity inhibition, real-time PCR and quantitative mass spectrometry can be applied. This review emphasizes on efflux pumps and their roles in transmitting bacterial resistance and an update plant-derived EPIs and strategies for identification.']\n",

Secondary metabolite accumulation in vitro or their efflux in culture medium has been elicited in the undifferentiated or differentiated tissue cultures of several plant species by the application of a low concentration of biotic and abiotic elicitors in the last three decades. Hairy root cultures are preferred for the application of elicitation due to their genetic and biosynthetic stability, high growth rate in growth regulator-free media, and production consistence in response to elicitor treatment. Elicitors act as signal, recognized by elicitor-specific receptors on the plant cell membrane and stimulate defense responses during elicitation resulting in increased synthesis and accumulation of secondary metabolites. Optimization of various parameters, such as elicitor type, concentration, duration of exposure, and treatment schedule is essential for the effectiveness of the elicitation strategies. Combined application of different elicitors, integration of precursor feeding, or replenishment of medium or in situ product recovery from the roots/liquid medium with the elicitor treatment have showed improved accumulation of secondary metabolites due to their synergistic effect.

We investigated the effects of tree species identity, species richness, and mycorrhizal type on leaf herbivory and pathogen infestation. We used a tree sapling experiment manipulating the two most common mycorrhizal types, arbuscular mycorrhiza and ectomycorrhiza, via respective tree species in monocultures and two-species mixtures. We visually assessed leaf herbivory and pathogen infestation rates, and measured concentrations of a suite of plant metabolites (amino acids, sugars, and phenolics), leaf elemental concentrations (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus), and tree biomass. Tree species and mycorrhizal richness had no significant effect on herbivory and pathogen infestation, whereas species identity and mycorrhizal type had. Damage rates were higher in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) than in ectomycorrhizal (EM) trees. Our structural equation model (SEM) indicated that elemental, but not metabolite concentrations, determined herbivory and pathogen infestation, suggesting that the investigated chemical defence strategies may not have been involved in the effects found in our study with tree saplings. Other chemical and physical defence strategies as well as species identity as its determinant may have played a more crucial role in the studied saplings. Furthermore, the SEM indicated a direct positive effect of AM trees on herbivory rates, suggesting that other dominant mechanisms, not considered here, were involved as well. We found differences in the attribution of elemental concentrations between the two rates. This points to the fact that herbivory and pathogen infestation are driven by distinct mechanisms.

An <i>in silico</i> structure-activity analysis was performed using ToxTree and NexusPrediction to suggest plausible mechanisms of toxicity and estimate toxicological endpoints of these compounds. Structural alerts were generated based on the presence of phenolic units with coordinating substituents that could potentially form quinoid structures, promote reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, bind to cellular structures, or damage chromosomes.

A method based on ultra performance convergence chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPC<sup>2</sup>-MS/MS) was established for the determination of 15 3-MCPDE in vegetable oils and fritters. Amino-packed columns were used to purify the samples. The analytical conditions were optimized, and the matrix effect was investigated. The sample was treated by column chromatography to remove glyceride and free fatty acids, which induce strong matrix effects. The amino-packed column was eluted with hexane and hexane-ethyl acetate (6:4, v/v). Every 1 mL of the eluent was analyzed using a UPC<sup>2</sup> and ACQUITY QDa detector. Elution curves were drawn based on the testing data and used to determine the collection volume. The collection volumes for 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol diesters and monoesters according to the elution curves were 7-14 mL and 3-9 mL. The collected eluent was mixed and dried under nitrogen flow at a temperature of 60℃. A hexane-isopropanol (98:2, v/v, 1 mL) mixture was used to dissolve the residue. The resulting solution was separated on a Viridis HSS C18 SB column (150 mm×2.1 mm, 1.8 μm) under gradient elution. Supercritical carbon dioxide and methanol (containing 40% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) were used as the mobile phases, and the flow rate was 1 mL/min. The separated compounds were analyzed by tandem MS with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source in positive and multiple reaction monitoring modes. Water (containing 97% isopropanol and 0.2% ammonia water) was used as the auxiliary pump mobile phase, and the flow rate was 0.2 mL/min. The method showed good linear relationships in the range of 0.5-100 μg/L (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.9973). The limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) were 0.01-0.68 μg/L (<i>S/N</i>=3) and 0.04-1.74 μg/L (<i>S/N</i>=10), respectively. The average recoveries (<i>n</i>=9) at the three spiked levels were in the range of 81.6%-98.5%. The relative standard deviations were in the range of 1.8%-6.4%. The matrix effects in the case of the oils and fritters were weak. The developed method was used to detect 44 oil samples and eight fritter samples. Meanwhile, some suspect 3-MCPDE compounds outside the scope of the investigation were analyzed based on their primary and secondary mass spectra. The detection rates of 3-MCPDE in oils and fritters were 84.1% and 87.5%, and their amounts were in the range of 0.024-4.481 mg/kg and 0.018-1.144 mg/kg, respectively. The detection rates of 3-MCPDE in rapeseed oil were higher compared to those for other kinds of oil. The method is specific, fast, simple, accurate, reliable, and environmentally friendly, in addition to being more sensitive than other methods and showing better matrix compatibility for oils. This method has been successfully used to determine the types and amounts of 3-MCPDE in vegetable oils and fritters. The research findings provided accurate data to assess the exposure risk of 3-MCPDE. The results of our experiment also provided valuable information for elucidating the formation mechanism of 3-MCPDE. The proposed method can be used to analyze waste edible oil based on large amounts of analysis data. However, this method has some limitations. The resolution ratio of the mass spectrometer used in this method is too low for the qualitative analysis of unknown compounds. The qualitative results for the suspect 3-MCPDE compounds are not particularly accurate, and a large variety of monomer standards are required for the quantitative determination of 3-MCPDE. The 3-MCPDE standards are expensive, and there is limited choice of these standards; moreover, they are difficult to synthesize. The poor ionization yield of 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol monoesters under the ESI conditions resulted in high LODs. Hence, it is necessary to develop a method for increasing the ionization of monoesters, for example, via derivatization.']\n",

      "Abstract: ['Phytochrome-dependent light signaling has been studied in several fungi. In Aspergillus nidulans light-stimulated phytochrome activates the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signaling pathway and thereby controls the expression of a large number of genes, many of which are related to stress responses. In a genome-wide expression analysis in A. nidulans we found that phytochrome, fphA, is under strict expression control of the central regulator of the sulfur-starvation response, MetR. This transcriptional regulator is required for the expression of genes involved in inorganic sulfur assimilation. In the presence of organic sulfur, MetR is probably ubiquitinated and possibly degraded and the transcription of sulfur-assimilation genes, e.g., sulfate permease, is turned off. The expression analysis described here revealed, however, that MetR additionally controls the expression of hundreds of genes, many of which are required for secondary metabolite production. We also show that metR mutation phenocopies fphA deletion, and five other histidine-hybrid kinases are down-regulated in the metR1 mutant. Furthermore, we found that light and phytochrome regulate the expression of at least three carbon-sulfur hydrolases. This work is a further step towards understanding the interplay between light sensing and metabolic pathways.']\n",

      "Abstract: ['Assemblages of insect herbivores are structured by plant traits such as nutrient content, secondary metabolites, physical traits, and phenology. Many of these traits are phylogenetically conserved, implying a decrease in trait similarity with increasing phylogenetic distance of the host plant taxa. Thus, a metric of phylogenetic distances and relationships can be considered a proxy for phylogenetically conserved plant traits and used to predict variation in herbivorous insect assemblages among co-occurring plant species.Using a Holarctic dataset of exposed-feeding and shelter-building caterpillars, we aimed at showing how phylogenetic relationships among host plants explain compositional changes and characteristics of herbivore assemblages.Our plant-caterpillar network data derived from plot-based samplings at three different continents included >28,000 individual caterpillar-plant interactions. We tested whether increasing phylogenetic distance of the host plants leads to a decrease in caterpillar assemblage overlap. We further investigated to what degree phylogenetic isolation of a host tree species within the local community explains abundance, density, richness, and mean specialization of its associated caterpillar assemblage.The overlap of caterpillar assemblages decreased with increasing phylogenetic distance among the host tree species. Phylogenetic isolation of a host plant within the local plant community was correlated with lower richness and mean specialization of the associated caterpillar assemblages. Phylogenetic isolation had no effect on caterpillar abundance or density. The effects of plant phylogeny were consistent across exposed-feeding and shelter-building caterpillars.Our study reveals that distance metrics obtained from host plant phylogeny are useful predictors to explain compositional turnover among hosts and host-specific variations in richness and mean specialization of associated insect herbivore assemblages in temperate broadleaf forests. As phylogenetic information of plant communities is becoming increasingly available, further large-scale studies are needed to investigate to what degree plant phylogeny structures herbivore assemblages in other biomes and ecosystems.']\n",
